For me personally, the influence of the previous weeks in the field of interspecies collaboration and non-human intelligences made it interesting to try to understand how these organisms work and whether it is possible to communicate with them without making genetic modifications. During the research, I realized how many approaches there are that are not comprehensible and that I was motivated by the direction of education and starter kits to simplify complexity and motivate more people to experiment. The intervention also opened up many new questions to me in the field of plant computing and non-human intelligences. How can we understand not only human-induced signals but also noise? and How do different organisms communicate with each other? Approaches \u00b6 Result \u00b6 we tried several things in our quest to understand the signals. firstly, we tried to read the signals by directly penetrating the plant with the pins, which was a very intrusive procedure and may have caused the signals we read. at this point, however, we did not yet understand how to understand or interpret the signals. later we found out that you can receive plant signals with heartbeat sensors at a much lower frequency, which we still couldn\u2019t understand. the signals from the plant were a constant noise, which could be caused by the electronic hardware or the plant itself. But when you interact with the plant (touch or water) you can definitely see a peak in the signals. that was also our final result of the first week\u2019s experiment. we receive signals and know that the plant sends signals when we cause them ourselves. now it would be interesting to understand the noise without us interacting with it","title":"04 Collective Intervention"},{"location":"term1/Design/CollectiveIntervention/#reflection","text":"During these two weeks, we formed new groups and carried out another intervention in the field of plant computing.

I used most of the prototyping roles already in my previous work but not that conciously and some of them only conceptual and with a small amount of people. Role 1:The prototype as an experimental component \u00b6 selftest This role is mainly used to check assumptions in order to test the application. I would use this role mainly to test a concept or idea, but at a later stage of the project process. It is often the easiest and fastest way to prototype, but of course does not take into account other people\u2019s opinions, which can be used, but is not the only approach. Especially in a project discovery phase, this method can limit the research space and design space. Most of the people I have worked with in the past have used this prototyping approach. This is also what I learned at my university. for example, I used it to test an app with clickdummy prototypes or for small proof of concepts in the form of an Arduino prototype. Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry \u00b6 I sometimes used it in the form of a questionnaire at the beginning of the project. Most of the time, however, we already knew what we wanted here and approached the questionnaire in a certain way. The real approach is not knowing the end goal. To ask and receive questions. Example: I did a research project on sustainable food for 4 months. The goal was to develop an idea and a low-fi prototype. We were really inexperienced in this field and we opened one topic after another and ended up where we didn\u2019t expect it before. Of course, also because the theme was very extensive for 4 months. I think this role takes time. It is also important to analyze everything considering the circumstances and the environment. Role 3: The prototype as a reasearch archetype \u00b6 As a tool to express a problem/topic. Give information and trigger thinking I know it mostly from exhibitions. Example: Exhibition Amsterdam a room with cameras which is tracking faces and interpreting peoples connection. Let people question privacy and monitoring. Role 4: The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry This Role of Prototyping is usefull to answer questions by making. Example: i explored in one semester with a planting system, and tested multiple ways to make home growing food more efficient but we also got tips from experts which lead us in a specific direction. Group exercice \u00b6 We did a little exercise in our group to better understand the roles of prototyping. We talked about past projects and classified them into the different roles. We noticed that in many projects we saw several roles of prototyping and we unconsciously used them simultaneously or distributed in the design process. Then we built a quick alternative prototype for a different person in the group. I built a porototype for Jorghe. he had a project for an alternative lint roller that worked like a razor and therefore had almost no wear parts. We put his project in role 1, because he tested it himself. I made a test kit to analyze the intuition of different users as well as the approach to different fabrics. This prototype is type role 4, because you don\u2019t know where the result will lead you and you approach the users with a question. My Extended Workspace \u00b6 As a further exercise, everyone created their own personal extended workspace. My workspace is divided into 2 sides, on the one hand collaborative possibilities with my network and things I can do at home alone. I have mainly worked on my laptop and designed digital products, but I have also gained some experience in 3d printing when I needed a case for an arduino prototype. Most of the things on the collaborative side are possibilities I have little or no experience in and hopefully will learn more about soon. The visualization shows me pretty clearly how much knowledge there is in collaboration with the people around me and in which fields I can learn a lot.

Maybe it was the change from everyday life that I enjoyed so much, but it definitely reminded me of nature and gave me a deeper understanding of agriculture that I didn\u2019t get in half a year of project work in a \u201chomefarming project\u201d. The expert knowledge was very valuable and the different planting layouts increased my interest in interspecies collaboration even more. But especially the simplicity of the solutions I was able to get to know during this week inspired me. How can we read nature \u00b6 In the quest to understand the intricate dance between nature and technology, certain key principles and practices emerge. Reading Nature \u00b6 The fundamental question posed is: \u201cHow can we read nature?\u201d Acknowledging that context is everything, the focus is on observing the edges between different habitats and understanding their mutual influence. The term \u201cecotone\u201d encapsulates the significance of these transitional areas. Additionally, the traditional agricultural technique of making land flat and building steps is explored as a means to regulate water flow. Technology\u2019s Desires \u00b6 Understanding what technology wants is another crucial aspect. The concept of \u201cprosumer,\u201d where one consumes what they produce, is highlighted. The production cycle, from extraction to processing/refinement, services, and management, is emphasized as a comprehensive framework. Agriculture and Innovation \u00b6 Pemaacriculture \u00b6 \u201cPemaacriculture\u201d introduces the idea of planting layouts. Emphasizing the importance of doing what you can, the approach encourages active involvement in maintenance practices. Polyculture and Monoculture \u00b6 Diving into farming practices, the benefits of polyculture (mixed high-sensed farm) are contrasted with the drawbacks of monoculture. The former promotes diversity, while the latter focuses on a single crop. Integration of Technology: Romi Project \u00b6 The intersection of agriculture and technology is exemplified by the Romi project, which explores robotics for microfarming. Further information can be found at Romi Project. Sustainable Practices \u00b6 Food Forest \u00b6 The concept of a food forest is introduced, illustrating a symbiotic relationship where one plant nourishes the next. This approach fosters sustainability and resilience in agricultural ecosystems. Rewilding \u00b6 Taking a bold step, rewilding is discussed as the reintroduction of animals into the land. This practice aims to overcome fears associated with certain species and restore ecological balance. Do Nothing Farm \u00b6 The innovative idea of a \u201cdo-nothing\u201d farm, originating from a Japanese inventor, involves using playbills with seeds.

Overall, the methodology gave me a lot of clarity and showed me many issues that I had not previously considered or was not aware of. It has helped me to efficiently find a good visualization of various topics I already know a little about, and to discover connections and new possibilities within these areas. 01 Collective Excercice \u00b6 In the \u201cBig Round\u201d, to be honest, I didn\u2019t understand a lot of points acoustically and as a result I did not contribute as much thematically. Nevertheless, it helped me to understand the approach of the methodology. After that, we tested the method again in the group and had a successful brainstorming round and drew cards that worked much better for me thematically. I was therefore very excited to put together my own Atlas and to find the right cards and topics for me afterwards. 02 Personal AoWS \u00b6 As a first draft, I looked through all the cards and formed pairs that resulted in interesting themes for me, which I then sorted out and found 3 favourite pairs. The decision to choose a final pair was not easy for me, because there was a lot of interesting potential in all of them. Thus I decided for an area that has been on my mind a lot this past year. How can we use AI\u2019s and data in a way that it makes sense? 03 Additions \u00b6 In addition to the existing cards, I have considered one opportunity area and two random triggers that I have personally encountered in the past and that are very important to me. One is the area of digital collaboration, which got rediscovered intensly around the time of the pandemic and required pure remote collaboration. It has proven to be a new opportunity area for many technologies. My other area of interest is inclusion and accessibility. Both of these vast topics could actually be opportunity areas as well, but I have classified them as random triggers because I think they should actually be considered in all opportunity areas that one chooses. The separation of the \u201csimilar\u201d topics is also consciously chosen because inclusion is often quickly labeled as an accessibility topic, but also includes cultural inclusion, linguistic inclusion, gender inclusion and much more. As in my understanding, these topics are as well a part of equality and kill-the-heteropatriarchy, but in my opinion were not directly visible among the proposed topics. 04 Multiscalar Personal Design Space \u00b6 I have merged my personal AoWS with my previous personal experience and toolset to create a multiscalar design space.

AI\u2019s and data that can be used to drive society forward, foster collaboration and promote inclusion. First ideas that came into my mind are in the field of maker education adn digital collaboration from human to human or from human to machine.

What is possible ? how can you become a part ? And how does a community project really work? In order to design concepts with others, you first have to understand how other projects have worked. The week felt like a kikoff for the rest of the year, as it was the first time you really got into action and did a community engagement intervention. At the same time, the workshops and the theme we ultimately chose for our intervention reminded me on my awareness of my surroundings. Design alone -> Design with others \u00b6 Tuesday - Soil, Wednesday - Land, Thursday - Connect, Friday - Intervene A discourse about why we should design with others. This week explored different spaces, where people come together in diverse and different fields. With the aspects of collaborative design in mind we discovered the layers of community driven spaces, like a shared community house called \u201cLa Borda\u201d and took part in various workshops focused on community engagement. SOIL and LAND were two paradox concepts that we were introduced to as well. Soil as nature\u2019s own community, where plants, insects, and microorganisms exist and live together. A living system. Land as a vast natural playground where a mix of human -made systems and nature takes place. While listening to some presentations in the workshops, questions like: \u201cWhy we should re-consider our roles while designing?\u201d and \u201cHow do we approach designing in complex and entangled contexts?\u201d were trigger questions or ideas that we explored throughout the week. The module \u201cDesigning for Others\u201d was led by Adria and Markel from Holon. Holon is a non profit cooperative \u201chelping many organizations become the new normal through design\u201d. It is based in Cooperlis, Barcelona. Friction \u00b6 As mentioned before we examined the concepts both of SOIL and LAND, to see how we could design within the communities dependent on both. We explored our role in these complex systems. As an one hour exercise in the beginning of the module we explored our surroundings (500 meters) in the neighborhood of Sants and analyzed it to find friction points to document. These points were triggers that showed tension and conflict. I concentrated on three themes that were very visual for me in my immediate surroundings: Trash, Reuse and decomposition. \u201cA cycle of life\u201d -> Trash hiding in between green spots, nature blooming around and in a community garden next to a construction site. And simple reusing techniques around the area. As using old plastic in efficient different ways or letting other materials decay. It was a living system of paradoxes within itself. After finding our personal friction points we split into groups based on the direction of thematically findings. Within our group, our primary emphasis revolved around the deterioration of soil and land in urban areas. The recurring pattern of construction followed by environmental neglect deeply resonated with us, prompting an inquiry into its correlation with political cycles and its implications for the well-being of the community. La Borda \u00b6 Together with Adria we visited La Borda, a cooperative housing complex in Barcelona. \u2028La Borda is a social housing project, where you can share the space collaboratively. It began 2012 where a group of neighbors decided to self-organize collectively to go up against the housing crisis in Barcelona. La Borda is constructed modular, so individuality is given, with almost zero energy consumption and the structure of six floors made solely out of CLT. This was particularly interesting for me to think about communal living models, the realization and maintenance of such living systems and their potential in expanding the idea of alternative housing concepts to go up against the housing crisis we all are facing. Group Intervention \u00b6 Our group was dedicated to the revitalization and repurposing of our neighborhood through regreening efforts. After exploring various concepts, we decided to create a workshop series aimed at transforming streets and connecting two parks or greenspaces. The overarching goal is to create more habitats for bees and other insects, thereby enhancing the greenery of our streets. The workshop series kicks off with an engaging gathering activity and a neighborhood walk, adopting a bee workshop approach to foster connections and brainstorm directions. These workshops are carefully designed to inspire and involve people\u2019s creativity in constructing insect housing while collaboratively discovering innovative solutions. To raise awareness for the event, we\u2019ve also developed an initial campaign to inform and engage the neighborhood.","title":"Design with Others"},{"location":"term1/Reflections/DesignWithOthers/#reflection","text":"This week has answered some questions that have accumulated over the previous weeks.

This enables us to communicate with developers and understand the difference and interplay between different subcategories of AI. Exhibition \u00b6 I found 4 exhibits at the exhibition at BCCC particularly interesting. Waterfall of meaning \u00b6 An artificial intelligence about the meaning of individual words. which was also an inspiration for our group project. i think it is particularly interesting here that the ai places the words in a space that is not immediately obvious to us in the first thought when you examine the meaning of a word. it is a neutral way of looking at the meaning of a word without thinking from a biased perspective. Brainbow \u00b6 An ai that can help to illuminate and trace connections between neurons. This AI illustrates that we can use Ai\u2019s to work more precisely, faster and easier, creating new possibilities. Slocum G3 Glider \u00b6 Ai combined with soft robotics to perform tasks underwater or in space that humans cannot do.

Especially I find the cooperation between nature and technology and different intelligences very interesting. However, the topic of genetic modifications has raised some ethical questions that I am not yet able to answer. I still don\u2019t know what I think about the intervening of natural evolution, as it has many advantages but also many risks. The last few weeks and the exercise of designing a GMO has triggered me to think about it and in my opinion it should be covered in education as the technology is already present and evolving and humanity will soon have to make collaborative and global decisions about it. 1. What is a GMO ? \u00b6 A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. This is often done to introduce a desirable trait from one organism into another, such as making a plant resistant to pests or a crop more nutritious. GMOs can be plants, animals, or microorganisms, and they are used in various fields including agriculture, medicine, and research. GMOs are primarily used in agriculture for various purposes, including: Resistance to Insect Damage : GMO crops are developed to be resistant to insect damage, allowing farmers to apply fewer spray pesticides to protect the crops, thus reducing the environmental impact of pesticide use. Tolerance to Herbicides : GMO crops that are tolerant to herbicides help farmers control weeds without damaging the crops. This reduces the need for tillage, which helps maintain soil health and lower fuel and labor use. Resistance to Plant Viruses : GMO crops, such as the Rainbow papaya, have been developed to be resistant to specific plant viruses, thereby preventing crop loss due to viral infections. Improving Yields and Nutritional Quality : GMO technologies offer more rapid crop improvement and novel genetic strategies for crop improvement, addressing the challenge of improving yields and nutritional quality to meet the growing demand for food in a sustainable way. Feed for Animals : Most GMO crops are used in food for animals like cows, chickens, and fish, contributing to the production of feed ingredients used in food. Reduced Need for Pesticides : Genetic engineering in agriculture has led to reduced costs for food production, reduced need for pesticides, and enhanced nutritional content in some crops. 2. How can we sustainably maintain clean cities with \u201cnatural\u201d organisms? \u00b6 2.1. How can we improve air quality in the urban underground using absorbing microorganisms? \u00b6 2.1.1. Problem \u00b6 Studies have shown that in the urban underground rail systems of many large cities there are increased levels of particulate matter, which we also tested in our last intervention in the design studio. These increased levels lead to poor air quality and increase the risk of asthma and cancer for daily passengers. 2.1.2. Research on Absorbing Bad Air Quality \u00b6 While there is research on using plants to improve air quality, such as in indoor environments, there is limited information specifically on using fungi, moss, or other organisms to absorb bad air quality in underground spaces. However, there is ongoing research on the use of plants and microorganisms to improve air quality in various settings, which could provide valuable insights. Plant genes modified to fight air polution Genetic modification of poplar trees saves air quality Genetic modified Houseplant Pothos to reduce Indoor Air Pollution 2.1.3. Considerations \u00b6 Creating an organism to absorb bad air quality in underground spaces would involve identifying or engineering an organism with the ability to effectively absorb pollutants and thrive in underground conditions. This could potentially involve genetic modification to enhance the organism\u2019s natural abilities or introduce new ones. Additionally, considerations such as the organism\u2019s impact on the surrounding environment and its ability to survive and reproduce in underground conditions need to be addressed. 2.1.4. How would it be possible ? \u00b6 Mushroom-Filled Wall Tiles : A design student at Brunel University in London has developed honeycomb tiles made from mycelium, the part of mushrooms that grows underground. These tiles, called Myco-Hex, are designed to absorb harmful hydrocarbon air pollution caused by traffic emissions and burning fossil fuels. The mycelium-fused fungi in the tiles safely absorbs hydrocarbons, helping to create cleaner air in towns and cities. see more Reishi Mushroom Extract : Research has shown that reishi mushroom extract can prevent the transmigration of particulate matter into the bloodstream, ultimately preventing oxidative stress caused by pollution exposure. This suggests the potential for using mushroom extracts to protect the body against damage caused by air pollution. see more Mycelium-Based Building Materials : The Growing Pavilion, a building in the Netherlands, is made from mycelium, the roots of mushrooms. As it grows, it helps to clean the air. Mycelium-based building materials are being used to create environmentally-friendly structures that contribute to air purification. see more 2.1.5. Conclusion \u00b6 The genetic modification of plants for air quality improvement involves the introduction of specific genes responsible for enhancing the plant\u2019s ability to capture and process air pollutants. In the case of the Neo P1 houseplant, the plant was genetically engineered to produce cytochrome P450 2E1 (2E1), a key enzyme in mammals that helps clear toxins from the body. This enzyme is involved in breaking down volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde, benzene, and chloroform, which are common indoor air pollutants. The specific gene responsible for encoding the cytochrome P450 2E1 enzyme was introduced into the pothos plant, enabling it to produce this enzyme and enhance its air purification capabilities. The genetic modification process likely involved the use of synthetic biology, metabolism engineering, and directed evolution of the root microbiome to achieve the desired air purification traits in the plant. Regarding the potential for transferring this snippet of DNA responsible for air purification from plants to mushrooms, the search results did not provide specific information on this topic. However, the transfer of specific genes or genetic elements from one organism to another, including from plants to fungi, is a concept within the realm of genetic engineering and biotechnology. The process of transferring genetic material between different organisms, known as transgenesis, has been a fundamental technique in genetic modification and biotechnology. The search results did not provide specific information on the genetic mechanisms responsible for how mushrooms absorb pollution. However, the potential for genetically modifying mushrooms or mycelium for air quality improvement would likely involve identifying and introducing specific genes or genetic elements responsible for enhancing the organism\u2019s ability to capture and process air pollutants. This process would require in-depth understanding of the genetic and biochemical mechanisms involved in pollutant absorption and metabolism in mushrooms or mycelium. In summary, the genetic modification of plants for air quality improvement involves the introduction of specific genes responsible for enhancing the plant\u2019s air purification capabilities. The potential for transferring these genetic traits to mushrooms or mycelium would involve the transfer of specific genes or genetic elements related to pollutant absorption and metabolism, requiring a comprehensive understanding of the genetic mechanisms involved in air quality improvement in fungi. Certain types of mushrooms and mycelium are adaptable to urban environments, including underground settings, and have the potential to contribute to air quality improvement. Their ability to grow without natural light and their capacity to absorb pollutants from the air make them promising candidates for environmental applications in urban and subterranean contexts. however, during my research i realized that both fungi and plants already have the ability to improve the air and that genetic modification can only enhance this function to clean the air faster, but this does not offer the organism any new function. Furthermore, there is already some proof that it works. that\u2019s why i tackled a second question, because the bacteria and pollutants are not only in the air but can also be found on streets and walls. 2.2. How can a natural alternative to chlorine help us clean the streets of big cities? \u00b6 2.2.1. Problem \u00b6 The most commonly used cleaning method in Barcelona involves the use of chlor-based cleaning agents sprayed on the streets at night. The impact of this method on the environment and human health is a concern. Chlor-based cleaning agents can have negative effects on the environment, including harming aquatic life and disrupting ecosystems. Additionally, exposure to chlor-based cleaning agents can pose health risks to humans, such as respiratory irritation and other health issues. 2.2.2. Alternative Organisms for Street Cleaning \u00b6 When considering alternative organisms or bacteria to clean the streets, it\u2019s important to focus on those that can absorb harmful bacteria without negatively impacting other species or the environment. Some potential options include using bacteria or organisms that have the ability to absorb harmful bacteria found in urban environments. These organisms could be applied in cleaning detergents or used to create an antibacterial layer on the streets. However, it\u2019s crucial to ensure that these alternative organisms do not harm beneficial species and ecosystems in the city. 2.2.3. Considerations \u00b6 There are various research projects and initiatives exploring the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for different purposes, including environmental remediation and public health. However, it\u2019s essential to consider the ethical implications and potential consequences of using GMOs in urban environments. Ethical questions that need to be addressed include the potential impact on biodiversity, unintended ecological consequences, and public acceptance of GMOs in urban settings. Additionally, it\u2019s important to conduct thorough risk assessments and engage in transparent communication with the public regarding the use of GMOs in city cleaning initiatives. 2.2.4. How would it be possible ? \u00b6 I have not found any existing research specific to this problem, but I have come up with three Opportunity areas that I have researched more deeply. The first option would be to stick with the method and try to treat bacteria daily but with some kind of natural cleaning agent. Baking Soda : Baking soda is an excellent cleaner and deodorizer that can be used for various cleaning purposes, including removing clogs and softening water. White Vinegar : Due to its high acidity, white vinegar can reduce surface bacteria, making it a safe alternative to bleach. Essential Oils : Certain essential oils, such as lemon, have antibacterial properties and can be used as natural disinfectants. Unscented Soap : Biodegradable unscented soap can be used as a natural cleaning solution for a variety of surfaces. However, this option requires a lot of work and the alternative cleaning agents found do not seem to be cheap or better for our human health. The second option would be to collect the bacteria and break them down into a kind of compost. Bioremediation Microorganisms : Certain naturally occurring microorganisms have the ability to break down and consume pollutants, including hydrocarbons and other contaminants found on urban streets. These microorganisms could be harnessed for their bioremediation capabilities to help clean and restore urban environments. Mycelium : Mycelium, the vegetative part of a fungus, has been explored for its potential in bioremediation and environmental cleanup. It has been used to absorb and digest a variety of pollutants, including hydrocarbons and heavy metals, and could potentially be applied to urban street cleaning as a self-recovering organism. Algae : Algae have been studied for their ability to absorb pollutants and contaminants from various environments. Certain species of algae have been shown to effectively remove heavy metals and other pollutants from water, and their potential for urban street cleaning could be further explored. With this option, the compost could even be further utilized to generate energy or promote plant growth for food production. The third option would be to apply a kind of permanent film, which would make the daily worry about bacteria redundant. Microbial Biofilms : Certain types of microbial biofilms, composed of diverse microorganisms, have been found to thrive in urban environments and exhibit self-recovering properties. These biofilms can form invisible layers on surfaces and have the ability to adapt to varying environmental conditions, including dry heat and wet seasons. Endophytic Bacteria and Fungi : Endophytic bacteria and fungi, which reside within plant tissues, have been studied for their potential in environmental remediation and could potentially be harnessed for street cleaning. These organisms are often invisible and can adapt to different environmental conditions, making them potential candidates for self-recovering street cleaning solutions. Biodegradable Polymers : While not organisms in the traditional sense, certain biodegradable polymers have been designed to mimic the self-recovering properties of living organisms. These polymers can be engineered to withstand dry heat and wet conditions while providing a sustainable and invisible solution for street cleaning. This Opportunity Area also offers the greatest potential for a GMO, as different disinfecting species of organisms could be crossed to get the best result, which is harmless to both humans and other important species in the urban environment, but at the same time absorbs harmful bacteria. with the right optimization, this film could possibly also be applied to the first question of air pollution and thus solve the overarching question \u201cHow can we sustainably maintain clean cities with \u201cnatural\u201d organisms?\u201d. 2.2.5. Conclusion \u00b6 In conclusion, the use of alternative organisms or bacteria, including GMOs, for cleaning urban environments such as Barcelona requires careful consideration of environmental impact, human health, and ethical implications. It\u2019s essential to conduct thorough research, risk assessments, and public engagement to ensure the responsible and sustainable implementation of such initiatives.","title":"GMO"},{"location":"term1/Reflections/GMO/#reflection","text":"The topic of microorganisms and non-human intelligences has generally become a topic of great interest to me over the last few weeks.

Conclusion"},{"location":"term1/Reflections/LwYoI/","text":"First Person Perspective \u00b6 In short, the first person perspective is to involve yourself in a design space and actively experience it in order to shape it. You become part of the community that develops the idea and design not for others but with others. Everything that surrounds you can and will influence your project. The first person perspective makes it possible to think by testing and experiencing. Magic Machines \u00b6 what you had to do \u00b6 For the first workshop, led by Kristina Andersen, we brought junk from home that could be used for prototyping to build a Low Fi prototype of a Companion. An object that accompanies us in everyday life but is not specifically adapted to us. To get started quickly with a prototype, we chose one of the 16 basic human desires. What did it end up being, and what materials did you use ? \u00b6 For my prototype I used a pencil, foam rubber wooden sticks and an old hairdryer to build a food spinner that can be modularly limited but can also randomly decide on a meal to cook or buy. What were you Thinking ? \u00b6 The first thought that came to my mind on the subject of \u201cneed of food\u201d was to randomly try new things. At the same time, it struck me how many decisions you can make about food when you try to break it down to its basic building blocks. and that you\u2019ll add more and more building blocks to bring in more randomness, but at the same time you\u2019ll control the randomness again. Why does it matter ? \u00b6 When using the magic machine, I realized that I had limited myself through the modularity and categorization. With the basic ingredients I chose, I still came up with dishes I already knew, which in retrospect is logical because I wrote down the categories while I was thinking about different dishes I knew. So the prototype was too controlled and couldn\u2019t give me new cooking ideas or create more variety. 1PP Research - Embodying your ideas \u00b6 I put myself in the Ai area for a day and tried to solve everything with ai. I only used ai to do the research, so I couldn\u2019t watch a video tutorial on youtube made by a human. I only followed the ai instructions. What happens when you involve yourself ? \u00b6 involving myself in the topic helped me to understand where i stand in the topic, what assumptions and prejudices i have and how much i still don\u2019t know. I already knew about chat Gpt and Perplexity ai, so I started researching straight away. I come from a UI/UX background, so I already knew a bit about what was possible, but I hadn\u2019t tried it myself yet. I immediately tried to take giant steps and test the ai without knowing which and how to use the tools. This naturally influenced the experiment, which meant that I was only able to detach myself from it late on and start from 0. What happens when you use yourself as an instrument ? \u00b6 Using myself as an instrument has helped me to change my perception of the subject. I suddenly saw the ai much more as a kind of companion who now accompanies me permanently and tries to understand how the au \u201cfeels\u201d the ai, how it tastes, how it sounds, how it thinks and how it looks. It has inspired me and triggered my imagination, giving me initial ideas on how to abstract it. Accepting that I am now actively working with the ai on a permanent basis and seeing her as a companion has raised new questions for me and shown me that with my initial approach I actually only wanted to take from the ai and facilitate my work without giving anything back, which is quite atypical for a well-functioning cycle.

The color range of this monitor would typically be 16.7 million colors, which is standard for most Full HD displays. A computer monitor displays visual information, such as text, images, videos, and graphics, generated by a computer or electronic device. It serves as a user interface, is essential for entertainment, gaming, professional work, and information presentation, and is used in various industries and educational settings. How does it work? \u00b6 It has 2 kinds inputs; power and data, on teh other side, the screen visuals are the output. There\u2019s a processor that gets information from the PC on which is connected. When it recives the inputs, the processor powers the LCD screen, LCDs work by controlling the orientation of liquid crystal molecules within each pixel to allow or block the passage of light. By using voltage and color filters, they create images and colors on the screen. Backlights provide the illumination. How is it built? \u00b6 The whole device consists of 2 main parts (external and internal) and different pieces inside them: 1.1. Frame: Made out of PMMA injection mode, it holds the screen to the general structure. 1.2. Backcover: Made out of HIPS injection mode, its acts as a container and protector of all the internal components of the monitor. Th user interacts with it by plugging and unplugging the device. 1.3. LCD Screen: The manufacture of an LCD screen involves steps like preparing glass substrates, adding thin-film transistors and color filters, aligning liquid crystals, sealing the cell, and placing a backlight and finally, the electronic components are integrated. 2.1. Internal container: Made of SPTE (Steel Plate Tinplate Electroplate) by metal cutting and folding in order to give it a structural resistance, it\u2019s function is to contain the rest of the internal parts of the device. 2.2. Power supply board: Made of different layers of FR-4 (fiberglass-reinforced epoxy), by printing the design on a copper-clad board, etching away excess copper, drilling holes, placing and soldering components, testing for functionality, and, if successful, assembling the final product. It\u2019s function is to convert the electricity taken from the plug into the motherboard. 2.3. Motherboard: The materials and manufacturing processes are the same as the Power Supply Board. The motherboard takes the information from the computer and sends it to the LCD screen. The part 1.3. LCD Screen has it\u2019s different components inside, which are: Backlight: This is not a layer within the LCD panel itself, but it is an essential component. The backlight is responsible for providing the light source that passes through the other layers to create the image. In this case, the technology is LED. 1.3.1. Rear Polarizer: The backlight produces unpolarized light. The rear polarizer is the first layer encountered by the light, and its role is to polarize the light so that it vibrates in a particular direction. 1.3.2. Glass Substrate: Two glass substrates, an upper and a lower one. Liquid crystals are sandwiched between these substrates. 1.3.3. Front Polarizer: Like the rear polarizer, the front polarizer is responsible for polarizing the light. However, it is oriented perpendicular to the rear polarizer. When the liquid crystals change orientation, they can affect the polarization of the light and determine whether it can pass through. 1.3.4. Liquid Crystals: These are the active elements of the LCD panel. Liquid crystals change their orientation in response to an applied electric field. This change in orientation affects the passage of polarized light. 1.3.5. Color Filters: Color filters are used to create the full range of colors. They are located above the front glass substrate and consist of red, green, and blue filters, which are arranged in a pattern to generate different colors. 1.3.6. Thin-Film Transistors (TFTs): Thin-film transistors are used to control the orientation of the liquid crystals. Each pixel typically has its own transistor, allowing for precise control of individual pixels. 1.3.7. Alignment Layers: These layers help ensure that the liquid crystals align properly when no voltage is applied. Why did it failed, or it wasn\u2019t used anymore? \u00b6 The older products were phased out and replaced by newer, technologically advanced alternatives that boasted significantly improved resolution and color quality. These cutting-edge replacements set a new standard in terms of visual fidelity, offering a superior and more vibrant color palette, as well as remarkable image clarity and detail. This transition to the latest products not only met the growing demands of consumers for enhanced visual experiences but also reflected the relentless pursuit of innovation and excellence within the industry. The current plugs are old and only support VGA connections, lacking HDMI compatibility. To address this issue, we need to obtain suitable adapters that can bridge the gap between these older VGA connectors and modern HDMI interfaces. These adapters facilitate the transmission of high-definition multimedia content, ensuring compatibility and integration of older equipment with contemporary display and audiovisual systems. Using these adapters allows for improved visual and audio quality, enhancing the functionality of the existing hardware within today\u2019s technological landscape.

LCD screen testing Testing \u00b6 Testing tools: \u00b6 Power Supply Multimeter Gives a certain amount of voltage to the components in a localized place Helps us measure the voltage, intensity, connectivity or resistance of the components General system testing \u00b6 We started the general testing after disassembeling the whole device. We attempted to connect back every component as it was before, to check what was wrong with it. We found out that the LCD screen worked and the power supply also but we couldn\u2019t send any image to the monitor. We concluded that the cable that connects the motherboard to the LCD screen wasn\u2019t working correctly. LCD screen testing \u00b6 We first disassembeled the different layers and frames leaving us with only the backlight connected to the boards. We tried powering the backlight with the power supply from the board. But the backlight didn\u2019t work even with higher voltage. While doing the testing we accidentally broke the cables connecting the LCD screen to the power supply. That\u2019s why we decided tear apart the backlight to test the LED strings alone. Using the cables that we knew that worked and the power supply, we managed to light the strings with a voltage of 27V. The connector has 4 different pins, each one of the lights a string of 10 LEDs, so we were able to control with section we wanted to light. From this testing we concluded that the cables connecting the LEDs with the power supply board were old and got broken during the process. Results \u00b6 How many motors did we find inside? \u00b6 The Samsung EX2220X monitor does not typically include any motors.It is primarily a display device with electronic components for video processing and adjustment, but it doesn\u2019t contain motors. Does it contain a computer or microcontroller? \u00b6 The monitor receives video signals from the connected device and displays them on its screen. While monitors often have some internal electronics for controlling settings like brightness, contrast, and color, they do not have a computer or microcontroller with general computing capabilities like running software or processing data independently. The actual computing tasks are handled by the device to which the monitor is connected. Did you find any sensors? \u00b6 While it has some basic sensors for power management and display adjustment purposes, it doesn\u2019t contain sensors for things like touch input, ambient light sensing, proximity detection, or accelerometers, which are commonly found in devices like smartphones and tablets.

Through a 6-month collaboration with Nuria at IAAC/Fablab Barcelona, we explored this tension between local and global AI in El Clot, a vibrant neighborhood in Barcelona. The project challenged the dominant paradigm where AI search systems like Google funnel local queries through global algorithms, extracting value from communities while returning generic results. Instead, we investigated how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) could create neighborhood-specific AI systems. Working directly with residents, students, and local organizations, LAIA became both a technical experiment and a community intervention\u2014exploring how AI can amplify local knowledge rather than replace it with algorithmic abstractions. Setup \u00b6 Technical infrastructure and community partnerships Technical Infrastructure \u00b6 We built a localized RAG system using neighborhood-specific data sources: local business directories, community event listings, resident interviews, and historical documentation about El Clot. The system prioritized hyperlocal knowledge over global search results. Rather than relying on massive datasets, we created a curated knowledge base that reflected the lived experience of the neighborhood\u2014from the best local bakeries to community organizing strategies. Community Partnership \u00b6 The collaboration with IAAC/Fablab Barcelona provided both technical resources and deep community connections. Nuria\u2019s local expertise was essential for navigating neighborhood dynamics and building trust with residents. We established partnerships with local schools, adult education centers, and community organizations to ensure the project served real needs rather than imposing external solutions. Intervention \u00b6 Community workshops and public engagement Student Workshops \u00b6 We conducted hands-on workshops with local students, teaching them to question AI systems and understand how algorithms shape their access to information. Students learned to compare local AI responses with global search results, developing critical digital literacy skills. Adult School Engagement \u00b6 Adult education sessions focused on practical applications: How could local AI help with job searches, housing information, or navigating city services? Participants shared their expertise while learning to interrogate algorithmic decision-making. Public Exhibition \u00b6 LAIA was exhibited at the ACT Festival at Akasha Hub, demonstrating the project\u2019s findings to a broader audience. The exhibition showcased the contrast between generic AI responses and hyperlocal knowledge, sparking conversations about digital sovereignty and community autonomy. Highlights & Insights \u00b6 Key learnings and project impact Community Knowledge vs. Global Algorithms \u00b6 The project revealed how global AI systems often miss nuanced local knowledge\u2014the informal networks, cultural practices, and community wisdom that actually make neighborhoods function. Local AI provided more relevant, contextual responses to resident queries. Digital Sovereignty in Practice \u00b6 LAIA demonstrated that communities can develop their own AI tools rather than accepting algorithmic colonization. By maintaining control over data and training processes, neighborhoods can preserve their autonomy while benefiting from AI assistance. Educational Impact \u00b6 Students and adults developed critical thinking skills about AI systems, learning to question algorithmic authority and understand how technology shapes their daily lives.

As cities globalize, communities weaken, covered by a focus on productivity. Online platforms replace traditional networks, taking the role of local institutions. Globalized media fuses cultural tastes, risking the loss of local identity. Laia addresses these challenges by empowering communities to reconnect and engage in neighborhood initiatives. By utilizing technology mindfully, the project transforms it into a tool for collective intelligence. By tackling the root causes of neighborhood disconnection, Laia aims to create more resilient, sustainable, and equitable communities. The Laia project started with a machine that asked people: \u201cWhat would you say to your city?\u201d. As the prototype progressed, we enabled transcribing user responses. To improve, we focused on defining Barcelona\u2019s voice, starting with the neighborhood of El Clot. Akasha Hub, a community in El Clot, provided essential references and became our first collaborator. We are reaching out to associations of El Clot while developing Laia. Laia\u2019s third version included an online form for residents to share their knowledge, ensuring answers incorporated collective wisdom. Currently, we conduct workshops with the community, gathering feedback to shape Laia\u2019s future versions. Our ongoing engagement aims to refine Laia and better serve the neighborhood\u2019s needs. Until beggining of 2025, we plan on expanding Laia with El Clot community to gain local recognition and become a reference for everyone. We aim to build a final prototype that can be used in the public space without supervision. Looking ahead on the long term, we envision the project evolving into a scalable platform that can be implemented in diverse urban contexts around the world. We would like to create a \u201cLaia Guide\u201d to collect and group all the steps we have done with the project in El Clot and make the project open source. Context \u00b6 The development of the Laia project began with the creation of a machine that could pose a question: \u201cWhat would you say to your city?\u201d Users could record their answers in audio format, and the machine would store these audio files. It functioned almost like a confessional, offering a speculative way for people to express their thoughts. You can find all the documentation for the first prototype in the MicroChallenge I page. Developments \u00b6 As the prototype evolved, we incorporated OpenAI technology into the machine through API calls. This enabled us to transcribe the user\u2019s audio responses, send them to ChatGPT, and play back an audio response. While this made the machine more \u201cuseful,\u201d the generated answers from OpenAI were not sufficiently interesting. They tended to be standard and corporate, lacking real engagement with the user. You can find all the documentation for the second prototype in the MicroChallange II page. To address this issue, we began researching what voice Barcelona would have. However, this question proved challenging to answer due to the city\u2019s vast scale. To simplify our approach, we decided to focus on a specific neighborhood and community. We reached out to Akasha Hub, a community of designers and makers in El Clot, Barcelona. They provided us with community references and other relevant information, becoming our first collaborators. With a focus on El Clot established, we familiarized ourselves with the area and began making contacts with associations recommended by Akasha Hub. During this period, we concurrently worked on both the community workshops and the technical aspects of the project. We developed a third version of the Tool. In this version, we created an online form accessible for everyone, allowing residents of El Clot to \u201cteach\u201d Laia their knowledge. This ensured that when people from El Clot interacted with Laia, they would receive answers that incorporated the collective knowledge of their neighbors. Next Steps \u00b6 For the rest of this year and beggining of 2025, we plan on expanding Laia within El Clot community to gain more recognition form the locals and become a reference for everyone, and also so we can design a final version of Laia. We aim to build a final prototype that can be used in the public spce without supervision. Looking ahead on the long term, we envision the Laia project evolving into a scalable platform that can be implemented in diverse urban contexts around the world.

By making the Laia framework an open source and reproducable project, we are committed to creating more resilient, sustainable, and equitable cities for future generations.","title":"Next Steps"},{"location":"term3/LAIAProject_old/#submit-your-knowledge-currently-limited-to-el-clot","text":"LAIA Website LAIA Instagram","title":"Submit your knowledge (currently limited to el Clot)"},{"location":"term3/LAIAProject_styled/","text":"Home / Term 3 / LAIA Project /* LAIA-specific styles */ :root { --accent-color: #a855f7; --accent-color-hover: rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.8); --accent-color-light: rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.1); --text-primary: #1f2937; --text-secondary: #4b5563; --text-muted: #6b7280; --bg-primary: #f9fafb; --bg-secondary: #ffffff; --card-bg: white; --card-border: #e5e7eb; } .accent-tag { background-color: var(--accent-color); color: white; } .hero-stat-card { background-color: var(--card-bg); border: 1px solid var(--card-border); } .text-theme-primary { color: var(--text-primary); } .text-theme-secondary { color: var(--text-secondary); } .text-theme-muted { color: var(--text-muted); } .bg-bg-primary { background-color: var(--bg-primary); } .bg-card-bg { background-color: var(--card-bg); } .font-human { font-family: \"Inter\", sans-serif; } .font-machine { font-family: \"JetBrains Mono\", monospace; } .hero-nav-btn { transition: all 0.3s ease; color: var(--text-muted); border-color: var(--card-border); text-decoration: none; } .hero-nav-btn:hover { background-color: var(--accent-color-light); border-color: var(--accent-color); color: var(--accent-color); } .collaborator-avatar { border-radius: 50%; } .github-icon { filter: var(--icon-filter, none); } LAIA A 6-month community intervention exploring local AI versus global search systems in Barcelona's El Clot neighborhood. Investigating how AI can serve local communities rather than extracting value for distant algorithms. Local AI Community RAG Barcelona Neighborhood When? 2023 - Now Stage Prototype GitHub Repository Explore LAIA Project Nuria Valsells Communication & Design IAAC Hosting Institution Marius Schairer Prototyping & Development Akasha Hub Collaboration & Exhibition Concept keyboard_arrow_down Setup keyboard_arrow_down Intervention keyboard_arrow_down Highlights keyboard_arrow_down Local AI systems serving the El Clot neighborhood community Concept \u00b6 Local AI vs global extraction LAIA emerged from a critical question: What happens when AI systems serve local communities instead of extracting data for global platforms? Through a 6-month collaboration with Nuria at IAAC/Fablab Barcelona, we explored this tension between local and global AI in El Clot, a vibrant neighborhood in Barcelona. The project challenged the dominant paradigm where AI search systems like Google funnel local queries through global algorithms, extracting value from communities while returning generic results. Instead, we investigated how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) could create neighborhood-specific AI systems. Working directly with residents, students, and local organizations, LAIA became both a technical experiment and a community intervention\u2014exploring how AI can amplify local knowledge rather than replace it with algorithmic abstractions. Setup \u00b6 Technical infrastructure and community partnerships Technical Infrastructure \u00b6 We built a localized RAG system using neighborhood-specific data sources: local business directories, community event listings, resident interviews, and historical documentation about El Clot. The system prioritized hyperlocal knowledge over global search results. Rather than relying on massive datasets, we created a curated knowledge base that reflected the lived experience of the neighborhood\u2014from the best local bakeries to community organizing strategies. Community Partnership \u00b6 The collaboration with IAAC/Fablab Barcelona provided both technical resources and deep community connections. Nuria\u2019s local expertise was essential for navigating neighborhood dynamics and building trust with residents. We established partnerships with local schools, adult education centers, and community organizations to ensure the project served real needs rather than imposing external solutions. Intervention \u00b6 Community workshops and public engagement Student Workshops \u00b6 We conducted hands-on workshops with local students, teaching them to question AI systems and understand how algorithms shape their access to information. Students learned to compare local AI responses with global search results, developing critical digital literacy skills. Adult School Engagement \u00b6 Adult education sessions focused on practical applications: How could local AI help with job searches, housing information, or navigating city services? Participants shared their expertise while learning to interrogate algorithmic decision-making. Public Exhibition \u00b6 LAIA was exhibited at the ACT Festival at Akasha Hub, demonstrating the project\u2019s findings to a broader audience. The exhibition showcased the contrast between generic AI responses and hyperlocal knowledge, sparking conversations about digital sovereignty and community autonomy. Highlights & Insights \u00b6 Key learnings and project impact Community Knowledge vs. Global Algorithms \u00b6 The project revealed how global AI systems often miss nuanced local knowledge\u2014the informal networks, cultural practices, and community wisdom that actually make neighborhoods function. Local AI provided more relevant, contextual responses to resident queries. Digital Sovereignty in Practice \u00b6 LAIA demonstrated that communities can develop their own AI tools rather than accepting algorithmic colonization. By maintaining control over data and training processes, neighborhoods can preserve their autonomy while benefiting from AI assistance. Educational Impact \u00b6 Students and adults developed critical thinking skills about AI systems, learning to question algorithmic authority and understand how technology shapes their daily lives. The workshops created lasting awareness about digital literacy and technological choice. Scalable Model \u00b6 The LAIA methodology provides a template for other communities seeking technological autonomy. The project\u2019s approach\u2014combining technical development with community engagement\u2014offers a replicable framework for local AI initiatives.

Each concept addresses specific challenges in current AI systems while building toward a more democratic and distributed future. Distributed Knowledge Training Decentralizing AI learning across community nodes Rather than centralizing AI training in massive data centers, distributed knowledge training spreads the computational load across community devices. Each node contributes processing power while maintaining local data sovereignty.

Each approach brings unique insights to the complex challenge of community-governed artificial intelligence. Comparative Framework Analysis \u00b6 A systematic comparison of different AI frameworks, architectures, and governance models to identify optimal patterns for community control. This approach involves: Framework evaluation : Comparing open-source AI tools (Ollama, LangChain, Open-WebUI) for community adaptability Architecture assessment : Analyzing centralized vs. distributed AI deployment strategies Governance model comparison : Studying different approaches to democratic AI oversight Learning in progress : Iteratively refining approaches based on comparative insights Reflection: Learning Through Comparison \u00b6 The comparative approach proved essential for understanding the trade-offs inherent in different technical and governance choices. By systematically evaluating frameworks like Ollama\u2019s local deployment against cloud-based solutions , we identified specific advantages of edge computing for community sovereignty. Similarly, comparing centralized platforms (like existing civic tech tools) with federated architectures revealed how technical infrastructure directly shapes democratic participation possibilities. This methodology enabled evidence-based decision-making rather than theoretical speculation, ensuring that Oatflake\u2019s architecture reflects proven advantages rather than untested assumptions. Research Through Design \u00b6 The primary methodology follows a Research through Design approach, where the development of technical prototypes generates knowledge about participatory AI systems. This iterative process involves: Prototyping as inquiry : Building functional AI systems to test governance concepts Community engagement : Involving stakeholders in design and evaluation processes Reflective practice : Documenting insights that emerge from making and testing Reflection: Making as Knowledge Generation \u00b6 Research through Design proved fundamental to understanding the practical challenges of community AI governance. Building actual prototypes like LAIA and Oatflake revealed implementation complexities that purely theoretical approaches would miss. The act of making forced confrontation with real technical constraints, user needs, and governance challenges. Each prototype became a thinking tool that generated new questions and insights. For example, developing Oatflake\u2019s voting interface revealed how technical design choices can either enable or hinder democratic participation, leading to iterative refinements based on community feedback. Action Research \u00b6 Working directly with communities to implement and refine AI governance structures. This participatory approach ensures: Co-creation processes : Communities as partners, not subjects Iterative development : Continuous feedback loops between research and practice Real-world validation : Testing concepts in authentic contexts Reflection: Community as Co-Researchers \u00b6 Action research transformed community members from research subjects into active co-investigators of AI governance. Working with neighborhood communities in the LAIA project and maker spaces through fablab connections revealed how different contexts require different approaches to democratic participation. This methodology highlighted the importance of cultural sensitivity in AI design - what works for tech-savvy communities may not translate to other contexts. The iterative feedback loops ensured that theoretical concepts were continuously tested against lived community experiences. Critical Design Practice \u00b6 Examining the power structures and assumptions embedded in AI systems through: Questioning existing paradigms : Challenging centralized AI development models Speculative prototyping : Exploring alternative futures for AI governance Ethical reflection : Considering implications of different design choices Reflection: Interrogating AI Power Structures \u00b6 Critical design practice forced continuous examination of whose interests are served by different technical choices. This approach revealed how seemingly neutral technical decisions - like choosing cloud vs. local processing - actually embed political assumptions about data ownership and community autonomy. Speculative prototyping allowed exploration of alternative futures where communities genuinely control their AI systems, challenging the dominant narrative that sophisticated AI requires centralized infrastructure. This critical lens was essential for developing truly democratic alternatives to existing AI paradigms. Technical Investigation \u00b6 Exploring the technical infrastructure necessary for community-controlled AI: Local deployment strategies : Investigating edge computing and quantization Governance mechanisms : Developing tools for collective decision-making Adaptability frameworks : Creating systems that can evolve with community needs Reflection: Bridging Technical and Social Requirements \u00b6 Technical investigation revealed that community governance requires specific technical affordances - systems must be transparent, modifiable, and locally controllable . Exploring quantization techniques and edge computing proved that sophisticated AI doesn\u2019t require massive infrastructure, democratizing access to advanced capabilities. The challenge was balancing technical sophistication with accessibility . Community-governed AI must be powerful enough to be useful while remaining simple enough for non-technical users to understand and control. This tension drove innovations in interface design and system architecture. MSCW Prioritization Framework \u00b6 Using the MoSCoW method to prioritize features and requirements: Must have : Core functionality for basic community AI governance Should have : Important features that enhance usability and control Could have : Desirable features that add value but aren\u2019t essential Won\u2019t have : Features explicitly excluded from current scope Reflection: Focusing on Essential Community Needs \u00b6 The MSCW framework proved crucial for maintaining focus on community empowerment over technical sophistication . By prioritizing governance transparency and local control as \u201cMust have\u201d features, we avoided the common trap of building technically impressive but democratically limited systems. This prioritization revealed that many features considered essential in commercial AI (like advanced analytics) are less important for community governance than basic transparency and user control. The framework helped maintain community-centered design principles throughout development. Scenario Planning \u00b6 Exploring different futures through structured scenario development: This framework helps anticipate different pathways for AI development and their implications for community governance. Reflection: Preparing for Multiple AI Futures \u00b6 Scenario planning helped navigate the uncertainty inherent in rapidly evolving AI landscapes. By exploring different futures - from highly centralized corporate control to fully distributed community networks - we could design systems robust enough to function across multiple potential outcomes. The 2x2 scenario matrix revealed that adaptability is more valuable than optimization for any single future. This insight drove the focus on modular, flexible architectures that can evolve with changing technological and social contexts rather than betting on specific technological trajectories. Interdisciplinary Integration \u00b6 Drawing insights from multiple fields: Computer Science : Technical implementation and system architecture Design Research : User-centered design and participatory methods Political Science : Governance theory and democratic participation Anthropology : Community dynamics and cultural considerations Ethics : Moral implications of AI systems and governance structures Reflection: Synthesizing Diverse Knowledge Domains \u00b6 Interdisciplinary integration proved essential for addressing the complexity of community-governed AI. Technical solutions alone couldn\u2019t address governance challenges, while social approaches without technical understanding remained impractical. The synthesis created novel approaches that neither field could generate independently. Working across disciplines required developing boundary objects - concepts and prototypes that could communicate across different knowledge communities. Oatflake itself became such a boundary object, enabling conversations between technologists, community organizers, and policy researchers. Documentation and Iteration \u00b6 Systematic documentation of the research process enables: Learning capture : Recording insights as they emerge Reproducibility : Enabling others to build on this work Community feedback : Sharing progress for ongoing input Academic contribution : Contributing to scholarly discourse on participatory AI Reflection: Knowledge as Community Resource \u00b6 Documentation became more than just academic requirement - it served as a community resource enabling others to adapt and extend the research. Open documentation of failures and challenges proved as valuable as success stories, helping others avoid similar pitfalls. The iterative documentation process revealed how transparent research practices mirror the democratic values embedded in community-governed AI. Making research processes visible enables community participation in knowledge creation, not just knowledge consumption. These complementary approaches create a robust framework for investigating collaborative AI systems, ensuring both theoretical rigor and practical relevance to communities seeking to govern their own AI technologies.","title":"Approaches"},{"location":"thesis/methodology/#research-approaches","text":"This research employs multiple complementary approaches to understand and develop collaborative AI frameworks.

Ollama\u2019s focus on local deployment directly validates our hypothesis that sophisticated AI can run on consumer hardware, making it accessible to communities without extensive resources. Its quantization approaches prove that model compression doesn\u2019t necessarily compromise functionality. LangChain\u2019s modular architecture influenced our thinking about building flexible AI pipelines that communities can adapt to their specific needs. The framework\u2019s emphasis on composable components mirrors our belief that AI systems should be assembled from community-controllable parts rather than monolithic black boxes. Raspberry Pi\u2019s accessibility demonstrates how open hardware can democratize computing power. The Pi 5\u2019s capabilities show that local AI processing is not just theoretical but practically achievable on affordable hardware, supporting our vision of community-owned AI infrastructure. The quantization research from IBM provides the technical foundation for our local processing claims, while Open-WebUI\u2019s community evaluation approaches validate our democratic governance mechanisms. These frameworks collectively prove that technically sophisticated, community-controlled AI is not just possible but already emerging.

Conversations \u00b6 Ernst, C. , Exchange about Local AI and Quantization, February 2025 Cominassi, L. , Exchange about Community Governance, March 2025 San Martin, D. , Conversation on adaptability for fablab, Mai 2025 Research Reflection: Community Insights and Validation \u00b6 These conversations provided essential ground-truthing for our theoretical frameworks. Ernst\u2019s insights on local AI and quantization helped validate the technical feasibility of our local processing approaches and provided practical guidance on hardware requirements and model optimization. Cominassi\u2019s expertise in community governance was crucial in shaping our democratic oversight mechanisms. These discussions helped refine our understanding of how communities actually make decisions about technology and what governance structures work in practice versus theory. San Martin\u2019s fablab perspective illuminated how our community AI concepts could integrate with existing maker spaces and community technology initiatives. This conversation highlighted the importance of building on existing community infrastructure rather than creating entirely new institutions. These exchanges demonstrate that community-governed AI must be developed through ongoing dialogue with practitioners, not just academic research. The insights from these conversations directly influenced the design of Oatflake\u2019s governance features and our approach to community engagement. Research Synthesis \u00b6 Hardware and Accessibility \u00b6 The research revealed that hardware choices fundamentally shape governance possibilities . Centralized, supercomputer-driven models create dependency and limit community control , while local, accessible hardware enables digital sovereignty and democratic participation . Quantization techniques and edge computing proved essential for democratizing AI access. The ability to run sophisticated models on Raspberry Pi or consumer laptops removes barriers to community adoption while maintaining local data sovereignty . Iterative Prototyping as Democratic Practice \u00b6 Iterative prototyping emerged as both a technical method and a democratic practice . By involving communities in ongoing development cycles, we can create AI systems that truly serve community needs rather than imposing external solutions. The research hypothesis - that iterative prototyping can create more accessible, community-driven AI systems - was validated through both literature review and practical implementation. Community engagement throughout development cycles ensures relevance and builds local capacity for ongoing governance. Central Research Question \u00b6 \u201cHow can we design accessible governance systems to enable sustainably adapting distributed intelligences?\u201d The research synthesis suggests that governance and technical architecture must co-evolve . Accessible governance requires accessible technology, while distributed intelligence requires distributed control mechanisms. The integration of these insights drives the development of community-governed AI systems like Oatflake. This research foundation continues to evolve through ongoing community engagement, technical development, and theoretical reflection. Each source contributes to a growing understanding of how democratic participation and technical sophistication can coexist in AI systems.","title":"Research"},{"location":"thesis/research/#research-context","text":"Academic foundations, methodological frameworks, and critical reflections This research builds upon diverse sources spanning AI governance, community participation, technical infrastructure, and design methodology.

The goal was to test whether established tools could serve as accessible interfaces for community AI governance. Hypothesis \u00b6 \u201cExisting community platforms like Slack can serve as intuitive interfaces for AI interaction, reducing barriers to adoption by leveraging familiar tools.\u201d Technical Implementation \u00b6 Architecture \u00b6 Platform : Slack workspace with custom bot integration AI Backend : Multiple model connections (Ollama, OpenAI) Data Handling : File uploads, conversation history Governance : Channel-based permissions and moderation Key Features Tested \u00b6 Natural language interaction with AI models File upload and processing capabilities Group conversation with AI participation Model switching and configuration Privacy controls and data management Setup Process \u00b6 The implementation required: 1. Slack App Configuration : Custom bot permissions and OAuth setup \u00b6 2. API Management : Multiple third-party service integrations \u00b6 3. Model Deployment : Local and cloud-based AI model access \u00b6 4. Security Configuration : API key management and user permissions \u00b6 Results and Findings \u00b6 Technical Challenges \u00b6 Complexity Barrier - Multiple API keys and service dependencies - Complex setup process requiring developer knowledge - Maintenance burden for keeping integrations updated Interface Limitations - Slack\u2019s UI constraints limited governance interface design - File handling restrictions (e.g., PDF uploads shown but not functional) - Limited customization for community-specific needs Dependency Issues - Reliance on multiple third-party services - Potential for service disruptions affecting community access - Vendor lock-in concerns for long-term community autonomy Community Insights \u00b6 Positive Aspects - Familiar interface reduced learning curve - Group conversation dynamics worked well - Real-time interaction felt natural Concerns Raised - Lack of transparency in AI decision-making - Difficulty understanding system limitations - Questions about data privacy and control Key Learnings \u00b6 1. Complexity vs. Accessibility Trade-off \u00b6 While feature-rich integrations are technically possible, they often create barriers that exclude community members without technical expertise. 2. Platform Dependence \u00b6 Using existing platforms limits community control and creates dependencies that may conflict with governance goals. 3. Interface Design Constraints \u00b6 Third-party platforms impose design limitations that can hinder the development of effective governance interfaces. 4. Maintenance Burden \u00b6 Complex integrations require ongoing technical maintenance that communities may not be able to sustain.

While the hands-on approach and exploration of natural materials were fascinating, the course was not related with my current research. The context and creative experiments were insightful and refreshing. While having some fun exploration without laptop the seminar highlighted the potential of sustainable dyeing techniques. BioChromes \u00b6 BioChromes are natural pigments found in plants, animals, and microorganisms. They serve as eco-friendly alternatives to synthetic dyes, which are linked to environmental harm through toxic waste and chemicals. By harnessing resources like leaves, fruit peels, fungi, and bacteria, BioChromes enable sustainable and interesting coloring for textiles. Key Benefits: \u00b6 Sustainability: Reduces reliance on harmful synthetic processes. Versatility: Yields diverse colors using natural pH adjustments and mordants. Materials & Tools \u00b6 Creating natural dyes requires a combination of tools, materials, and ingredients to achieve consistent and vibrant results. Tools: \u00b6 Pots for heating Measuring cups and spoons Strainers Protective gloves Optional: Scale and pH testing strips for precision Key Ingredients: \u00b6 Mordants: Substances like alum (for bright colors) or iron (for darker shades) that fix dyes to fabric. Tannins: Natural compounds such as oak tannins, found in many plants, enhance dye bonding. pH Modifiers: Adjust color tones using lemon, vinegar, or sodium bicarbonate. Fabric Preparation: \u00b6 Weigh and Cut: Measure fabric weight for accurate mordant and dye calculations. Scour Fabric: Clean the fabric based on type: Silk: Warm water rinse. Cotton, Viscose, Linen: One-hour soak with sodium carbonate. Dyeing Process: \u00b6 Calculate mordant amounts: ~12% alum for bright colors. ~1% iron for darker shades. Simmer the fabric in the dye bath for 60 minutes. Hang fabric to dry naturally. Natural Dye Examples \u00b6 Red Cabbage \u00b6 Pink: 200ml dye bath + 6 teaspoons lemon juice. Purple: 200ml dye bath + 12% alum. Dark Blue: 200ml dye bath + 1% iron. Eucalyptus \u00b6 Light Yellow: 350ml dye bath + \u00bd lemon. Golden: 350ml dye bath + 20g alum. Gray: 200ml dye bath + \u00bd teaspoon iron. Experiment Proceses \u00b6 01 Material Collection: Gathered organic waste like leaves, fruit peels, and vegetable scraps. 02 Dyeing Process: Experimented with pH levels, temperatures, and natural mordants like alum, lemon, and iron to extract vibrant colors. 03 Pigment Creation: Transformed leftover dye baths into pigments by mixing with alum and baking soda. Takeaway \u00b6 While not immediately useful for mypersonal research, the seminar emphasized the importance of sustainability in design and offered a deeper understanding of natural dyeing processes. These techniques could inspire future applications in creative and environmentally conscious projects and for my freetime asside from my personal research. Further Ideas \u00b6 My initial idea was to use Basil as the color not only might get a strong green but also might smell good. The result was brown color though. As a Second idea i wanted to use the Ube fruit as it has a strong natural purple color and it even might change with the ph value like the cabbage but i couldn\u2019t find any fruit in the given timeframe. If one day i will find the fruit I will try it.","title":"Biochromes"},{"location":"year2/BioChrome/#reflection","text":"The BioChromes seminar offered an engaging introduction to natural dyeing and sustainable pigment creation.

During the LLUM 2025 festival, we created a space where Barcelona residents could share what they imagine for tomorrow. The installation combined physical interaction with AI processing to create a unique collective artwork. Each person\u2019s future vision was processed, analyzed, and integrated into a growing visual narrative that evolved throughout the festival. By inviting participants to speak their hopes aloud, the project transformed individual dreams into collective data, creating a living archive of community aspirations during one of Barcelona\u2019s most celebrated cultural events. Architecture \u00b6 Technical infrastructure and AI processing pipeline Real-time Processing Pipeline \u00b6 The technical architecture combined several innovative approaches to capture, process, and visualize spoken futures in real-time. Voice-to-text processing captured spoken visions while AI analysis performed semantic categorization of emerging themes. Voice-to-Text Processing : Real-time capture of spoken future visions using advanced speech recognition AI Analysis : Semantic analysis and categorization of themes using natural language processing Visual Generation : Dynamic visualization of collective hopes and patterns Interactive Display : Large-scale public interface for community engagement Technical Implementation \u00b6 The installation ran on an Intel NUC with optimized processing pipeline: 1 question \u2192 3 inputs \u2192 1 output To ensure smooth public space experience: - Audio filtering detected volume and transcribed speech - Content moderation replaced inappropriate words with emojis before public display - LLM-generated description enriched input for image generation model - ESP32 communication over local WiFi controlled LED animations on microphone - Local website interface synchronized with main processing script - Supabase integration for data archiving and online capture Scalable Infrastructure \u00b6 Built using modern web technologies and deployed on robust cloud infrastructure to handle the festival\u2019s high visitor volume. The system processed thousands of interactions while maintaining real-time responsiveness and data integrity. Exhibition \u00b6 Public installation and community engagement Festival Integration \u00b6 Located in Parc del Poblenou during LLUM 2025, the installation attracted thousands of participants over the festival weekend. The physical setup created an inviting space where technology met human expression. Technical Setup \u00b6 The installation featured professional-grade equipment designed for outdoor festival conditions: Large interactive touchscreen displays with weather-resistant housing Professional audio capture system with noise cancellation Ambient lighting that responded to interaction patterns Real-time visualization of collective data trends Community Impact \u00b6 The installation created a unique community space where strangers shared intimate hopes and dreams, fostering connection through technology and art. Participants reported feeling part of something larger than themselves. Insights & Impact \u00b6 Key learnings and community patterns Future Vision Patterns \u00b6 The project revealed fascinating patterns in how people envision their futures, providing insights into collective consciousness and community aspirations: Common Themes : Family, environment, technology, and community featured prominently across all age groups Language Patterns : Hopes were expressed more concretely and specifically than fears or concerns Cultural Diversity : Multiple languages and cultural perspectives enriched the dataset Intergenerational Differences : Age groups showed distinct patterns in future concerns and aspirations Technology as Community Bridge \u00b6 This project demonstrated how public art installations can serve as platforms for collective reflection and community building, while exploring the intersection of AI, creativity, and human expression. Technology became a medium for deeper human connection rather than a barrier.

While we couldn\u2019t fully achieve our intended result, the process highlighted the importance of material choice, airtightness, and mold design in achieving success. Despite the challenges, the attempt inspired us for more ideas and showed us areas for improvement, such as using better materials and optimizing mold shapes. The Seminar was really interesting and i wish i would have more time to spend on this topic, currently it\u2019s not my research direction thogh. After exploring with the food material and thinking a lot about potential use cases I would say there is better use cases than inflatable food and with the next experiment i would do something more related to Nature inspired mechanisms like fish swimming or bird wings movement. About Soft Robotics \u00b6 Soft robotics emphasizes flexibility, adaptability, and safety, drawing inspiration from natural organisms. Key components include soft actuators, flexible sensors, and durable materials like elastomers, hydrogels or biomaterials. Its applications span healthcare, agriculture, exploration, and even consumer products. Experiment Summary \u00b6 Goal: Create an inflatable chocolate mold featuring the \u201cChocacademy\u201d font. \u00b6 Steps: \u00b6 01 Mold Preparation: Designed and 3D-printed the mold. 02 Material Experimentation: Used an edible silicone paste to fill the mold. 03 Mechanism Setup: Programmed an Arduino (Flora) to connect to a motor for air inflation. 04 Testing: Covered mold holes, attempted inflation, and observed the results. 05 Result: The Prototype is not inflating because of the thickness and flexibility of the edible silicon. Challenges & Learnings: \u00b6 Achieved only slight inflation due to air leakage and a thick mold cover. Incomplete inflation of the font area highlighted the need for a fully sealed and thinner mold. The porosity and stickiness of edible silicone proved to be a limitation. Next Steps: \u00b6 Experiment with non-porous, less sticky materials like regular silicone. Redesign molds, potentially using circular shapes for uniform inflation. Refine the process to incorporate chocolate and achieve the envisioned design. Try other mechanisms besides of food applications. Try more with silicon. Test Vinyl Soft robots aswell.","title":"Soft Robotics"},{"location":"year2/Soft-Robotics/#reflection","text":"Our experiment with soft robotics to create inflatable chocolate was both a creative exploration and a valuable learning experience.

The Seminar was really interesting and i wish i would have more time to spend on this topic, currently it\u2019s not my research direction thogh. After exploring with the food material and thinking a lot about potential use cases I would say there is better use cases than inflatable food and with the next experiment i would do something more related to Nature inspired mechanisms like fish swimming or bird wings movement.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"year2/Soft-Robotics/#about-soft-robotics","text":"Soft robotics emphasizes flexibility, adaptability, and safety, drawing inspiration from natural organisms.

Learning how to efficiently navigate KiCad\u2019s tools helped streamline my design workflow. The process of transitioning from schematic design to PCB layout demonstrated the importance of careful planning and iteration. I gained a deeper appreciation for board constraints, such as track width and clearance, which impact both performance and manufacturability. A major takeaway was the importance of modularity in electronics. By referencing pin names instead of physical numbers, we ensured greater flexibility in design modifications. Additionally, exporting PCB layouts in SVG format allowed for better documentation and potential CNC milling compatibility. Inspiration: \u00b6 How to connect SAMD11 with Raspberry Pi \u2197 Turn on/off button for Raspberry Pi \u2197 Electronics Seminar Summary \u00b6 During the electronics seminar, We learned how to install the necessary libraries and configure the design tools for PCB development. The process involved installing libraries from a cloned repository, including Fab and Fab Pretty. We practiced essential functions in KiCad, such as: - A : Adding components - M : Moving components - R : Rotating components - Ctrl + L : Adding labels - D : Dragging components with wires A key principle emphasized was ensuring all components share the same ground connection. When designing a circuit, programming the SAMD microcontroller requires an SWD interface. Once the schematic was created, I learned how to transfer it to a PCB layout by selecting \u201cUpdate PCB from Schematic\u201d . In the PCB design phase, I adjusted the board setup settings to: - Clearance: 0.4mm - Track width: 0.35mm - Via size: 1.2mm - Via hole: 0.8mm - DP width: 0.35mm - DP gap: 0.4mm Best practices included avoiding sharp angles in PCB traces, ensuring sufficient spacing for soldering, and referencing pin names instead of physical pin numbers. Additionally, adjusting the grid size in KiCad allowed for more precise wire movements. To define the PCB shape, I accessed the Edge.Cuts layer and adjusted its settings to 0.8mm . Finally, exporting the board outline as an SVG file was done through the Plot and Export function. PCB Design \u00b6 Through this project, I reinforced my skills in integrating microcontrollers with AI-driven hardware . The experience aligns well with my ongoing work on local AI systems , strengthening my ability to create compact, autonomous embedded solutions. Moving forward, I plan to refine my PCB layouts further, explore multi-layer designs, and improve power efficiency in future projects. For the final project, I conceptualized a system integrating an SAMD11 microcontroller with a Raspberry Pi , featuring an on/off button, status LED, and an LCD screen . Once flashed, this system should function independently of a USB connection and operate within my local AI server , which I built for my thesis project. PCB production \u00b6 We learned about many different production processes, where 3D printing Circuits was defineteley the most fascinating one to me. But for the assignment we used a process we can follow in our fablab in BCN which has a SRM-20 Roland CNC milling machine for cutting circuits ou of kupper sheets. The requirement for the board design was to use only a one sided layout to simplify the process for the first try. for the cutting we needed to export the design as png to turn them into the .rml files for the milling machine. important is that to color the fields correctly for each cutting step. While the holes are black during cutting the traces they need to be white when cutting the holes (but substracting the outline of the hole). I could achieve the curved layout with Figma. First you need to export the design as a svg in KiCad. Then you can resort layers and change shape of the vectors in figma. But of course there will be no security about the path distance anymore which can cause errors later. exporting the png from figma also turned out to be not the best, as i had to measure it again and convert it in Indesign into the correct 1000x1000px format. here are the final png exported in 1000x1000px: Download Traces \u2191 Download Traces \u2191 Download Traces \u2191 Design and Cut Files: \u00b6 Download KiCad files Download rml Files for CNC milling","title":"Electronics"},{"location":"year2/Fabacademy/electronics/#electronics-design-reflection","text":"This seminar lead by Daniel Mateos and Josep Mart\u00ed gave me a initial understanding of PCB design, circuit programming, and component integration.
