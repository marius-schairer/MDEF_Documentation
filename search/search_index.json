I was also able to get to know some of the groups and project ideas that emerged, but I was happy to be able to create a new space with the other people who were missing, which suited us all better. Overall, the exercise still helped me to understand in which areas my classmates have skills and/or are interested. Shared Design Space \u00b6 To get us on the same page as a group, we first exchanged ideas verbally on the roof of iaac, which meant that at first glance we didn\u2019t have too much in common. Nevertheless, we decided to work together and not attach ourselves to a completed team. In order to bring our design spaces together independently of the class, we started by introducing our individual design spaces to each other and put all the cards on the table that were included in the card deck. We immediately noticed connections when several people used the same card to explain something or when topics were close and connections were made. Intervention \u00b6 For our intervention, we have chosen a scenario area that connects many areas and therefore us. Our interest in non-human intelligence, environmental sensing and inter-species collaboration led us to underground public transportation. The underground is interesting from the perspective of shared space with other people, but also with bacteria, noise, stress, leisure, education and more. People from every imaginable background travel by public transport and are therefore automatically confronted with the circumstances associated with it. We had many different ideas to encourage interaction between people or to address issues in this collaborative space. but in the end, because of our other interests in low tech and environmental sensing, we decided to use an air quality sensor and take some measurements. We found some studies on air quality in london and newyork tramways and heard about the health consequences. So we wanted to take huge steps right away and visualize the data we were measuring to trigger interpersonal interaction and address an issue that many people don\u2019t know about. How sustainable is our sustainable mode of transport in the end for our bodies? But we quickly realized that for the first intervention we had to limit our idea and maybe start by testing the values before visualizing them, which is what we ended up doing.

For me personally, the influence of the previous weeks in the field of interspecies collaboration and non-human intelligences made it interesting to try to understand how these organisms work and whether it is possible to communicate with them without making genetic modifications. During the research, I realized how many approaches there are that are not comprehensible and that I was motivated by the direction of education and starter kits to simplify complexity and motivate more people to experiment. The intervention also opened up many new questions to me in the field of plant computing and non-human intelligences. How can we understand not only human-induced signals but also noise? and How do different organisms communicate with each other? Approaches \u00b6 Result \u00b6 we tried several things in our quest to understand the signals. firstly, we tried to read the signals by directly penetrating the plant with the pins, which was a very intrusive procedure and may have caused the signals we read. at this point, however, we did not yet understand how to understand or interpret the signals. later we found out that you can receive plant signals with heartbeat sensors at a much lower frequency, which we still couldn\u2019t understand. the signals from the plant were a constant noise, which could be caused by the electronic hardware or the plant itself. But when you interact with the plant (touch or water) you can definitely see a peak in the signals. that was also our final result of the first week\u2019s experiment. we receive signals and know that the plant sends signals when we cause them ourselves. now it would be interesting to understand the noise without us interacting with it","title":"Collective Intervention"},{"location":"term1/Design/CollectiveIntervention/#reflection","text":"During these two weeks, we formed new groups and carried out another intervention in the field of plant computing.

I used most of the prototyping roles already in my previous work but not that conciously and some of them only conceptual and with a small amount of people. Role 1:The prototype as an experimental component \u00b6 selftest This role is mainly used to check assumptions in order to test the application. I would use this role mainly to test a concept or idea, but at a later stage of the project process. It is often the easiest and fastest way to prototype, but of course does not take into account other people\u2019s opinions, which can be used, but is not the only approach. Especially in a project discovery phase, this method can limit the research space and design space. Most of the people I have worked with in the past have used this prototyping approach. This is also what I learned at my university. for example, I used it to test an app with clickdummy prototypes or for small proof of concepts in the form of an Arduino prototype. Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry \u00b6 I sometimes used it in the form of a questionnaire at the beginning of the project. Most of the time, however, we already knew what we wanted here and approached the questionnaire in a certain way. The real approach is not knowing the end goal. To ask and receive questions. Example: I did a research project on sustainable food for 4 months. The goal was to develop an idea and a low-fi prototype. We were really inexperienced in this field and we opened one topic after another and ended up where we didn\u2019t expect it before. Of course, also because the theme was very extensive for 4 months. I think this role takes time. It is also important to analyze everything considering the circumstances and the environment. Role 3: The prototype as a reasearch archetype \u00b6 As a tool to express a problem/topic. Give information and trigger thinking I know it mostly from exhibitions. Example: Exhibition Amsterdam a room with cameras which is tracking faces and interpreting peoples connection. Let people question privacy and monitoring. Role 4: The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry This Role of Prototyping is usefull to answer questions by making. Example: i explored in one semester with a planting system, and tested multiple ways to make home growing food more efficient but we also got tips from experts which lead us in a specific direction. Group exercice \u00b6 We did a little exercise in our group to better understand the roles of prototyping. We talked about past projects and classified them into the different roles. We noticed that in many projects we saw several roles of prototyping and we unconsciously used them simultaneously or distributed in the design process. Then we built a quick alternative prototype for a different person in the group. I built a porototype for Jorghe. he had a project for an alternative lint roller that worked like a razor and therefore had almost no wear parts. We put his project in role 1, because he tested it himself. I made a test kit to analyze the intuition of different users as well as the approach to different fabrics. This prototype is type role 4, because you don\u2019t know where the result will lead you and you approach the users with a question. My Extended Workspace \u00b6 As a further exercise, everyone created their own personal extended workspace. My workspace is divided into 2 sides, on the one hand collaborative possibilities with my network and things I can do at home alone. I have mainly worked on my laptop and designed digital products, but I have also gained some experience in 3d printing when I needed a case for an arduino prototype. Most of the things on the collaborative side are possibilities I have little or no experience in and hopefully will learn more about soon. The visualization shows me pretty clearly how much knowledge there is in collaboration with the people around me and in which fields I can learn a lot.

Maybe it was the change from everyday life that I enjoyed so much, but it definitely reminded me of nature and gave me a deeper understanding of agriculture that I didn\u2019t get in half a year of project work in a \u201chomefarming project\u201d. The expert knowledge was very valuable and the different planting layouts increased my interest in interspecies collaboration even more. But especially the simplicity of the solutions I was able to get to know during this week inspired me. How can we read nature \u00b6 In the quest to understand the intricate dance between nature and technology, certain key principles and practices emerge. Reading Nature \u00b6 The fundamental question posed is: \u201cHow can we read nature?\u201d Acknowledging that context is everything, the focus is on observing the edges between different habitats and understanding their mutual influence. The term \u201cecotone\u201d encapsulates the significance of these transitional areas. Additionally, the traditional agricultural technique of making land flat and building steps is explored as a means to regulate water flow. Technology\u2019s Desires \u00b6 Understanding what technology wants is another crucial aspect. The concept of \u201cprosumer,\u201d where one consumes what they produce, is highlighted. The production cycle, from extraction to processing/refinement, services, and management, is emphasized as a comprehensive framework. Agriculture and Innovation \u00b6 Pemaacriculture \u00b6 \u201cPemaacriculture\u201d introduces the idea of planting layouts. Emphasizing the importance of doing what you can, the approach encourages active involvement in maintenance practices. Polyculture and Monoculture \u00b6 Diving into farming practices, the benefits of polyculture (mixed high-sensed farm) are contrasted with the drawbacks of monoculture. The former promotes diversity, while the latter focuses on a single crop. Integration of Technology: Romi Project \u00b6 The intersection of agriculture and technology is exemplified by the Romi project, which explores robotics for microfarming. Further information can be found at Romi Project. Sustainable Practices \u00b6 Food Forest \u00b6 The concept of a food forest is introduced, illustrating a symbiotic relationship where one plant nourishes the next. This approach fosters sustainability and resilience in agricultural ecosystems. Rewilding \u00b6 Taking a bold step, rewilding is discussed as the reintroduction of animals into the land. This practice aims to overcome fears associated with certain species and restore ecological balance. Do Nothing Farm \u00b6 The innovative idea of a \u201cdo-nothing\u201d farm, originating from a Japanese inventor, involves using playbills with seeds. The plants emerge naturally when it rains, requiring minimal intervention and eliminating the need for pesticides.

What is possible ? how can you become a part ? And how does a community project really work? In order to design concepts with others, you first have to understand how other projects have worked. The week felt like a kikoff for the rest of the year, as it was the first time you really got into action and did a community engagement intervention. At the same time, the workshops and the theme we ultimately chose for our intervention reminded me on my awareness of my surroundings. Design alone -> Design with others \u00b6 Tuesday - Soil, Wednesday - Land, Thursday - Connect, Friday - Intervene A discourse about why we should design with others. This week explored different spaces, where people come together in diverse and different fields. With the aspects of collaborative design in mind we discovered the layers of community driven spaces, like a shared community house called \u201cLa Borda\u201d and took part in various workshops focused on community engagement. SOIL and LAND were two paradox concepts that we were introduced to as well. Soil as nature\u2019s own community, where plants, insects, and microorganisms exist and live together. A living system. Land as a vast natural playground where a mix of human -made systems and nature takes place. While listening to some presentations in the workshops, questions like: \u201cWhy we should re-consider our roles while designing?\u201d and \u201cHow do we approach designing in complex and entangled contexts?\u201d were trigger questions or ideas that we explored throughout the week. The module \u201cDesigning for Others\u201d was led by Adria and Markel from Holon. Holon is a non profit cooperative \u201chelping many organizations become the new normal through design\u201d. It is based in Cooperlis, Barcelona. Friction \u00b6 As mentioned before we examined the concepts both of SOIL and LAND, to see how we could design within the communities dependent on both. We explored our role in these complex systems. As an one hour exercise in the beginning of the module we explored our surroundings (500 meters) in the neighborhood of Sants and analyzed it to find friction points to document. These points were triggers that showed tension and conflict. I concentrated on three themes that were very visual for me in my immediate surroundings: Trash, Reuse and decomposition. \u201cA cycle of life\u201d -> Trash hiding in between green spots, nature blooming around and in a community garden next to a construction site. And simple reusing techniques around the area. As using old plastic in efficient different ways or letting other materials decay. It was a living system of paradoxes within itself. After finding our personal friction points we split into groups based on the direction of thematically findings. Within our group, our primary emphasis revolved around the deterioration of soil and land in urban areas. The recurring pattern of construction followed by environmental neglect deeply resonated with us, prompting an inquiry into its correlation with political cycles and its implications for the well-being of the community. La Borda \u00b6 Together with Adria we visited La Borda, a cooperative housing complex in Barcelona. \u2028La Borda is a social housing project, where you can share the space collaboratively. It began 2012 where a group of neighbors decided to self-organize collectively to go up against the housing crisis in Barcelona. La Borda is constructed modular, so individuality is given, with almost zero energy consumption and the structure of six floors made solely out of CLT. This was particularly interesting for me to think about communal living models, the realization and maintenance of such living systems and their potential in expanding the idea of alternative housing concepts to go up against the housing crisis we all are facing. Group Intervention \u00b6 Our group was dedicated to the revitalization and repurposing of our neighborhood through regreening efforts. After exploring various concepts, we decided to create a workshop series aimed at transforming streets and connecting two parks or greenspaces. The overarching goal is to create more habitats for bees and other insects, thereby enhancing the greenery of our streets. The workshop series kicks off with an engaging gathering activity and a neighborhood walk, adopting a bee workshop approach to foster connections and brainstorm directions. These workshops are carefully designed to inspire and involve people\u2019s creativity in constructing insect housing while collaboratively discovering innovative solutions.

Especially I find the cooperation between nature and technology and different intelligences very interesting. However, the topic of genetic modifications has raised some ethical questions that I am not yet able to answer. I still don\u2019t know what I think about the intervening of natural evolution, as it has many advantages but also many risks. The last few weeks and the exercise of designing a GMO has triggered me to think about it and in my opinion it should be covered in education as the technology is already present and evolving and humanity will soon have to make collaborative and global decisions about it. 1. What is a GMO ? \u00b6 A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. This is often done to introduce a desirable trait from one organism into another, such as making a plant resistant to pests or a crop more nutritious. GMOs can be plants, animals, or microorganisms, and they are used in various fields including agriculture, medicine, and research. GMOs are primarily used in agriculture for various purposes, including: Resistance to Insect Damage : GMO crops are developed to be resistant to insect damage, allowing farmers to apply fewer spray pesticides to protect the crops, thus reducing the environmental impact of pesticide use. Tolerance to Herbicides : GMO crops that are tolerant to herbicides help farmers control weeds without damaging the crops. This reduces the need for tillage, which helps maintain soil health and lower fuel and labor use. Resistance to Plant Viruses : GMO crops, such as the Rainbow papaya, have been developed to be resistant to specific plant viruses, thereby preventing crop loss due to viral infections. Improving Yields and Nutritional Quality : GMO technologies offer more rapid crop improvement and novel genetic strategies for crop improvement, addressing the challenge of improving yields and nutritional quality to meet the growing demand for food in a sustainable way. Feed for Animals : Most GMO crops are used in food for animals like cows, chickens, and fish, contributing to the production of feed ingredients used in food. Reduced Need for Pesticides : Genetic engineering in agriculture has led to reduced costs for food production, reduced need for pesticides, and enhanced nutritional content in some crops. 2. How can we sustainably maintain clean cities with \u201cnatural\u201d organisms? \u00b6 2.1. How can we improve air quality in the urban underground using absorbing microorganisms? \u00b6 2.1.1. Problem \u00b6 Studies have shown that in the urban underground rail systems of many large cities there are increased levels of particulate matter, which we also tested in our last intervention in the design studio. These increased levels lead to poor air quality and increase the risk of asthma and cancer for daily passengers. 2.1.2. Research on Absorbing Bad Air Quality \u00b6 While there is research on using plants to improve air quality, such as in indoor environments, there is limited information specifically on using fungi, moss, or other organisms to absorb bad air quality in underground spaces. However, there is ongoing research on the use of plants and microorganisms to improve air quality in various settings, which could provide valuable insights. Plant genes modified to fight air polution Genetic modification of poplar trees saves air quality Genetic modified Houseplant Pothos to reduce Indoor Air Pollution 2.1.3. Considerations \u00b6 Creating an organism to absorb bad air quality in underground spaces would involve identifying or engineering an organism with the ability to effectively absorb pollutants and thrive in underground conditions. This could potentially involve genetic modification to enhance the organism\u2019s natural abilities or introduce new ones. Additionally, considerations such as the organism\u2019s impact on the surrounding environment and its ability to survive and reproduce in underground conditions need to be addressed. 2.1.4. How would it be possible ? \u00b6 Mushroom-Filled Wall Tiles : A design student at Brunel University in London has developed honeycomb tiles made from mycelium, the part of mushrooms that grows underground. These tiles, called Myco-Hex, are designed to absorb harmful hydrocarbon air pollution caused by traffic emissions and burning fossil fuels. The mycelium-fused fungi in the tiles safely absorbs hydrocarbons, helping to create cleaner air in towns and cities. see more Reishi Mushroom Extract : Research has shown that reishi mushroom extract can prevent the transmigration of particulate matter into the bloodstream, ultimately preventing oxidative stress caused by pollution exposure. This suggests the potential for using mushroom extracts to protect the body against damage caused by air pollution. see more Mycelium-Based Building Materials : The Growing Pavilion, a building in the Netherlands, is made from mycelium, the roots of mushrooms. As it grows, it helps to clean the air. Mycelium-based building materials are being used to create environmentally-friendly structures that contribute to air purification. see more 2.1.5. Conclusion \u00b6 The genetic modification of plants for air quality improvement involves the introduction of specific genes responsible for enhancing the plant\u2019s ability to capture and process air pollutants. In the case of the Neo P1 houseplant, the plant was genetically engineered to produce cytochrome P450 2E1 (2E1), a key enzyme in mammals that helps clear toxins from the body. This enzyme is involved in breaking down volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde, benzene, and chloroform, which are common indoor air pollutants. The specific gene responsible for encoding the cytochrome P450 2E1 enzyme was introduced into the pothos plant, enabling it to produce this enzyme and enhance its air purification capabilities. The genetic modification process likely involved the use of synthetic biology, metabolism engineering, and directed evolution of the root microbiome to achieve the desired air purification traits in the plant. Regarding the potential for transferring this snippet of DNA responsible for air purification from plants to mushrooms, the search results did not provide specific information on this topic. However, the transfer of specific genes or genetic elements from one organism to another, including from plants to fungi, is a concept within the realm of genetic engineering and biotechnology. The process of transferring genetic material between different organisms, known as transgenesis, has been a fundamental technique in genetic modification and biotechnology. The search results did not provide specific information on the genetic mechanisms responsible for how mushrooms absorb pollution. However, the potential for genetically modifying mushrooms or mycelium for air quality improvement would likely involve identifying and introducing specific genes or genetic elements responsible for enhancing the organism\u2019s ability to capture and process air pollutants. This process would require in-depth understanding of the genetic and biochemical mechanisms involved in pollutant absorption and metabolism in mushrooms or mycelium. In summary, the genetic modification of plants for air quality improvement involves the introduction of specific genes responsible for enhancing the plant\u2019s air purification capabilities. The potential for transferring these genetic traits to mushrooms or mycelium would involve the transfer of specific genes or genetic elements related to pollutant absorption and metabolism, requiring a comprehensive understanding of the genetic mechanisms involved in air quality improvement in fungi. Certain types of mushrooms and mycelium are adaptable to urban environments, including underground settings, and have the potential to contribute to air quality improvement. Their ability to grow without natural light and their capacity to absorb pollutants from the air make them promising candidates for environmental applications in urban and subterranean contexts. however, during my research i realized that both fungi and plants already have the ability to improve the air and that genetic modification can only enhance this function to clean the air faster, but this does not offer the organism any new function. Furthermore, there is already some proof that it works. that\u2019s why i tackled a second question, because the bacteria and pollutants are not only in the air but can also be found on streets and walls. 2.2. How can a natural alternative to chlorine help us clean the streets of big cities? \u00b6 2.2.1. Problem \u00b6 The most commonly used cleaning method in Barcelona involves the use of chlor-based cleaning agents sprayed on the streets at night. The impact of this method on the environment and human health is a concern. Chlor-based cleaning agents can have negative effects on the environment, including harming aquatic life and disrupting ecosystems. Additionally, exposure to chlor-based cleaning agents can pose health risks to humans, such as respiratory irritation and other health issues. 2.2.2. Alternative Organisms for Street Cleaning \u00b6 When considering alternative organisms or bacteria to clean the streets, it\u2019s important to focus on those that can absorb harmful bacteria without negatively impacting other species or the environment. Some potential options include using bacteria or organisms that have the ability to absorb harmful bacteria found in urban environments. These organisms could be applied in cleaning detergents or used to create an antibacterial layer on the streets. However, it\u2019s crucial to ensure that these alternative organisms do not harm beneficial species and ecosystems in the city. 2.2.3. Considerations \u00b6 There are various research projects and initiatives exploring the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for different purposes, including environmental remediation and public health. However, it\u2019s essential to consider the ethical implications and potential consequences of using GMOs in urban environments. Ethical questions that need to be addressed include the potential impact on biodiversity, unintended ecological consequences, and public acceptance of GMOs in urban settings. Additionally, it\u2019s important to conduct thorough risk assessments and engage in transparent communication with the public regarding the use of GMOs in city cleaning initiatives. 2.2.4. How would it be possible ? \u00b6 I have not found any existing research specific to this problem, but I have come up with three Opportunity areas that I have researched more deeply. The first option would be to stick with the method and try to treat bacteria daily but with some kind of natural cleaning agent. Baking Soda : Baking soda is an excellent cleaner and deodorizer that can be used for various cleaning purposes, including removing clogs and softening water. White Vinegar : Due to its high acidity, white vinegar can reduce surface bacteria, making it a safe alternative to bleach. Essential Oils : Certain essential oils, such as lemon, have antibacterial properties and can be used as natural disinfectants. Unscented Soap : Biodegradable unscented soap can be used as a natural cleaning solution for a variety of surfaces. However, this option requires a lot of work and the alternative cleaning agents found do not seem to be cheap or better for our human health. The second option would be to collect the bacteria and break them down into a kind of compost. Bioremediation Microorganisms : Certain naturally occurring microorganisms have the ability to break down and consume pollutants, including hydrocarbons and other contaminants found on urban streets. These microorganisms could be harnessed for their bioremediation capabilities to help clean and restore urban environments. Mycelium : Mycelium, the vegetative part of a fungus, has been explored for its potential in bioremediation and environmental cleanup. It has been used to absorb and digest a variety of pollutants, including hydrocarbons and heavy metals, and could potentially be applied to urban street cleaning as a self-recovering organism. Algae : Algae have been studied for their ability to absorb pollutants and contaminants from various environments. Certain species of algae have been shown to effectively remove heavy metals and other pollutants from water, and their potential for urban street cleaning could be further explored. With this option, the compost could even be further utilized to generate energy or promote plant growth for food production. The third option would be to apply a kind of permanent film, which would make the daily worry about bacteria redundant. Microbial Biofilms : Certain types of microbial biofilms, composed of diverse microorganisms, have been found to thrive in urban environments and exhibit self-recovering properties. These biofilms can form invisible layers on surfaces and have the ability to adapt to varying environmental conditions, including dry heat and wet seasons. Endophytic Bacteria and Fungi : Endophytic bacteria and fungi, which reside within plant tissues, have been studied for their potential in environmental remediation and could potentially be harnessed for street cleaning. These organisms are often invisible and can adapt to different environmental conditions, making them potential candidates for self-recovering street cleaning solutions. Biodegradable Polymers : While not organisms in the traditional sense, certain biodegradable polymers have been designed to mimic the self-recovering properties of living organisms. These polymers can be engineered to withstand dry heat and wet conditions while providing a sustainable and invisible solution for street cleaning. This Opportunity Area also offers the greatest potential for a GMO, as different disinfecting species of organisms could be crossed to get the best result, which is harmless to both humans and other important species in the urban environment, but at the same time absorbs harmful bacteria. with the right optimization, this film could possibly also be applied to the first question of air pollution and thus solve the overarching question \u201cHow can we sustainably maintain clean cities with \u201cnatural\u201d organisms?\u201d. 2.2.5. Conclusion \u00b6 In conclusion, the use of alternative organisms or bacteria, including GMOs, for cleaning urban environments such as Barcelona requires careful consideration of environmental impact, human health, and ethical implications. It\u2019s essential to conduct thorough research, risk assessments, and public engagement to ensure the responsible and sustainable implementation of such initiatives.","title":"GMO"},{"location":"term1/Reflections/GMO/#reflection","text":"The topic of microorganisms and non-human intelligences has generally become a topic of great interest to me over the last few weeks.

I still don\u2019t know what I think about the intervening of natural evolution, as it has many advantages but also many risks.

This is often done to introduce a desirable trait from one organism into another, such as making a plant resistant to pests or a crop more nutritious. GMOs can be plants, animals, or microorganisms, and they are used in various fields including agriculture, medicine, and research. GMOs are primarily used in agriculture for various purposes, including: Resistance to Insect Damage : GMO crops are developed to be resistant to insect damage, allowing farmers to apply fewer spray pesticides to protect the crops, thus reducing the environmental impact of pesticide use. Tolerance to Herbicides : GMO crops that are tolerant to herbicides help farmers control weeds without damaging the crops. This reduces the need for tillage, which helps maintain soil health and lower fuel and labor use. Resistance to Plant Viruses : GMO crops, such as the Rainbow papaya, have been developed to be resistant to specific plant viruses, thereby preventing crop loss due to viral infections. Improving Yields and Nutritional Quality : GMO technologies offer more rapid crop improvement and novel genetic strategies for crop improvement, addressing the challenge of improving yields and nutritional quality to meet the growing demand for food in a sustainable way.

You become part of the community that develops the idea and design not for others but with others. Everything that surrounds you can and will influence your project. The first person perspective makes it possible to think by testing and experiencing. Magic Machines \u00b6 what you had to do \u00b6 For the first workshop, led by Kristina Andersen, we brought junk from home that could be used for prototyping to build a Low Fi prototype of a Companion. An object that accompanies us in everyday life but is not specifically adapted to us. To get started quickly with a prototype, we chose one of the 16 basic human desires. What did it end up being, and what materials did you use ? \u00b6 For my prototype I used a pencil, foam rubber wooden sticks and an old hairdryer to build a food spinner that can be modularly limited but can also randomly decide on a meal to cook or buy. What were you Thinking ? \u00b6 The first thought that came to my mind on the subject of \u201cneed of food\u201d was to randomly try new things. At the same time, it struck me how many decisions you can make about food when you try to break it down to its basic building blocks. and that you\u2019ll add more and more building blocks to bring in more randomness, but at the same time you\u2019ll control the randomness again. Why does it matter ? \u00b6 When using the magic machine, I realized that I had limited myself through the modularity and categorization. With the basic ingredients I chose, I still came up with dishes I already knew, which in retrospect is logical because I wrote down the categories while I was thinking about different dishes I knew. So the prototype was too controlled and couldn\u2019t give me new cooking ideas or create more variety. 1PP Research - Embodying your ideas \u00b6 I put myself in the Ai area for a day and tried to solve everything with ai. I only used ai to do the research, so I couldn\u2019t watch a video tutorial on youtube made by a human. I only followed the ai instructions. What happens when you involve yourself ? \u00b6 involving myself in the topic helped me to understand where i stand in the topic, what assumptions and prejudices i have and how much i still don\u2019t know. I already knew about chat Gpt and Perplexity ai, so I started researching straight away. I come from a UI/UX background, so I already knew a bit about what was possible, but I hadn\u2019t tried it myself yet. I immediately tried to take giant steps and test the ai without knowing which and how to use the tools. This naturally influenced the experiment, which meant that I was only able to detach myself from it late on and start from 0. What happens when you use yourself as an instrument ? \u00b6 Using myself as an instrument has helped me to change my perception of the subject. I suddenly saw the ai much more as a kind of companion who now accompanies me permanently and tries to understand how the au \u201cfeels\u201d the ai, how it tastes, how it sounds, how it thinks and how it looks. It has inspired me and triggered my imagination, giving me initial ideas on how to abstract it. Accepting that I am now actively working with the ai on a permanent basis and seeing her as a companion has raised new questions for me and shown me that with my initial approach I actually only wanted to take from the ai and facilitate my work without giving anything back, which is quite atypical for a well-functioning cycle. What if I helped the ai and did tasks for it so that it could develop and we could ultimately develop together? what if there was an ai concept in which not just a few super-smart developers defined how the ai should develop, how it should think and what its limits are? What if there was a distributed citizen-participatory ai development ? Did anything change about the way of working ? \u00b6 Because I worked alone and the experiment had no specific goal other than to put myself in the subject, I was not restricted in my thinking and could follow every thought no matter how long it took or how crazy it was. I learned to come to terms with my own abilities and to understand that assumptions in an idea can be quickly disproved in active experience. What does it mean for your future work ? \u00b6 In my future work i will mainly use the method to start a new project and gain a quick and deep understanding. So far, I have tended to tackle huge topics such as sustainable nutrition or inclusion in mobility, which always required external expert knowledge. In retrospect, the first-person perspective would have helped me to find a direction more quickly and to generate knowledge in order to then approach the right experts that I need for my project and to avoid unnecessary questions or to discover things that an expert might overlook due to their long experience. Of course, I wouldn\u2019t put all my faith in one way of thinking and no longer believe in experts, but I will use it in a hybrid format to be able to change my perspective in a project. Another possible application would be to use the first person perspective to help other people change their perspective, for example in a workshop format. After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration ? \u00b6 Seeing the experiments of others helped me to understand how simple a setup can be and that I often approach things far too complicated. Thematically, I was able to recognize myself in many areas. on the one hand, of course, with people who also played with perception and made themselves intensely dependent on one thing, but on the other hand also people who tackled topics that I also address in my designspace.","title":"Living with Your Own Ideas"},{"location":"term1/Reflections/LwYoI/#first-person-perspective","text":"In short, the first person perspective is to involve yourself in a design space and actively experience it in order to shape it.

It has inspired me and triggered my imagination, giving me initial ideas on how to abstract it. Accepting that I am now actively working with the ai on a permanent basis and seeing her as a companion has raised new questions for me and shown me that with my initial approach I actually only wanted to take from the ai and facilitate my work without giving anything back, which is quite atypical for a well-functioning cycle. What if I helped the ai and did tasks for it so that it could develop and we could ultimately develop together? what if there was an ai concept in which not just a few super-smart developers defined how the ai should develop, how it should think and what its limits are?

The color range of this monitor would typically be 16.7 million colors, which is standard for most Full HD displays. A computer monitor displays visual information, such as text, images, videos, and graphics, generated by a computer or electronic device. It serves as a user interface, is essential for entertainment, gaming, professional work, and information presentation, and is used in various industries and educational settings. How does it work? \u00b6 It has 2 kinds inputs; power and data, on teh other side, the screen visuals are the output. There\u2019s a processor that gets information from the PC on which is connected. When it recives the inputs, the processor powers the LCD screen, LCDs work by controlling the orientation of liquid crystal molecules within each pixel to allow or block the passage of light. By using voltage and color filters, they create images and colors on the screen. Backlights provide the illumination. How is it built? \u00b6 The whole device consists of 2 main parts (external and internal) and different pieces inside them: 1.1. Frame: Made out of PMMA injection mode, it holds the screen to the general structure. 1.2. Backcover: Made out of HIPS injection mode, its acts as a container and protector of all the internal components of the monitor. Th user interacts with it by plugging and unplugging the device. 1.3. LCD Screen: The manufacture of an LCD screen involves steps like preparing glass substrates, adding thin-film transistors and color filters, aligning liquid crystals, sealing the cell, and placing a backlight and finally, the electronic components are integrated. 2.1. Internal container: Made of SPTE (Steel Plate Tinplate Electroplate) by metal cutting and folding in order to give it a structural resistance, it\u2019s function is to contain the rest of the internal parts of the device. 2.2. Power supply board: Made of different layers of FR-4 (fiberglass-reinforced epoxy), by printing the design on a copper-clad board, etching away excess copper, drilling holes, placing and soldering components, testing for functionality, and, if successful, assembling the final product. It\u2019s function is to convert the electricity taken from the plug into the motherboard. 2.3. Motherboard: The materials and manufacturing processes are the same as the Power Supply Board. The motherboard takes the information from the computer and sends it to the LCD screen. The part 1.3. LCD Screen has it\u2019s different components inside, which are: Backlight: This is not a layer within the LCD panel itself, but it is an essential component. The backlight is responsible for providing the light source that passes through the other layers to create the image. In this case, the technology is LED. 1.3.1. Rear Polarizer: The backlight produces unpolarized light. The rear polarizer is the first layer encountered by the light, and its role is to polarize the light so that it vibrates in a particular direction. 1.3.2. Glass Substrate: Two glass substrates, an upper and a lower one. Liquid crystals are sandwiched between these substrates. 1.3.3. Front Polarizer: Like the rear polarizer, the front polarizer is responsible for polarizing the light. However, it is oriented perpendicular to the rear polarizer. When the liquid crystals change orientation, they can affect the polarization of the light and determine whether it can pass through. 1.3.4. Liquid Crystals: These are the active elements of the LCD panel. Liquid crystals change their orientation in response to an applied electric field. This change in orientation affects the passage of polarized light. 1.3.5. Color Filters: Color filters are used to create the full range of colors. They are located above the front glass substrate and consist of red, green, and blue filters, which are arranged in a pattern to generate different colors. 1.3.6. Thin-Film Transistors (TFTs): Thin-film transistors are used to control the orientation of the liquid crystals. Each pixel typically has its own transistor, allowing for precise control of individual pixels. 1.3.7. Alignment Layers: These layers help ensure that the liquid crystals align properly when no voltage is applied. Why did it failed, or it wasn\u2019t used anymore? \u00b6 The older products were phased out and replaced by newer, technologically advanced alternatives that boasted significantly improved resolution and color quality. These cutting-edge replacements set a new standard in terms of visual fidelity, offering a superior and more vibrant color palette, as well as remarkable image clarity and detail. This transition to the latest products not only met the growing demands of consumers for enhanced visual experiences but also reflected the relentless pursuit of innovation and excellence within the industry. The current plugs are old and only support VGA connections, lacking HDMI compatibility. To address this issue, we need to obtain suitable adapters that can bridge the gap between these older VGA connectors and modern HDMI interfaces. These adapters facilitate the transmission of high-definition multimedia content, ensuring compatibility and integration of older equipment with contemporary display and audiovisual systems. Using these adapters allows for improved visual and audio quality, enhancing the functionality of the existing hardware within today\u2019s technological landscape.

LCD screen testing Testing \u00b6 Testing tools: \u00b6 Power Supply Multimeter Gives a certain amount of voltage to the components in a localized place Helps us measure the voltage, intensity, connectivity or resistance of the components General system testing \u00b6 We started the general testing after disassembeling the whole device. We attempted to connect back every component as it was before, to check what was wrong with it. We found out that the LCD screen worked and the power supply also but we couldn\u2019t send any image to the monitor. We concluded that the cable that connects the motherboard to the LCD screen wasn\u2019t working correctly. LCD screen testing \u00b6 We first disassembeled the different layers and frames leaving us with only the backlight connected to the boards. We tried powering the backlight with the power supply from the board. But the backlight didn\u2019t work even with higher voltage. While doing the testing we accidentally broke the cables connecting the LCD screen to the power supply. That\u2019s why we decided tear apart the backlight to test the LED strings alone. Using the cables that we knew that worked and the power supply, we managed to light the strings with a voltage of 27V. The connector has 4 different pins, each one of the lights a string of 10 LEDs, so we were able to control with section we wanted to light. From this testing we concluded that the cables connecting the LEDs with the power supply board were old and got broken during the process. Results \u00b6 How many motors did we find inside? \u00b6 The Samsung EX2220X monitor does not typically include any motors.It is primarily a display device with electronic components for video processing and adjustment, but it doesn\u2019t contain motors. Does it contain a computer or microcontroller? \u00b6 The monitor receives video signals from the connected device and displays them on its screen. While monitors often have some internal electronics for controlling settings like brightness, contrast, and color, they do not have a computer or microcontroller with general computing capabilities like running software or processing data independently. The actual computing tasks are handled by the device to which the monitor is connected. Did you find any sensors? \u00b6 While it has some basic sensors for power management and display adjustment purposes, it doesn\u2019t contain sensors for things like touch input, ambient light sensing, proximity detection, or accelerometers, which are commonly found in devices like smartphones and tablets.

After the dialogues, I decided to put the topic of intelligence and interspecies collaboration into context and somehow create added value, so I first had to zoom out again and try to understand how I could put the research into a meaningful context.

After the dialogues, I decided to put the topic of intelligence and interspecies collaboration into context and somehow create added value, so I first had to zoom out again and try to understand how I could put the research into a meaningful context.

I had only heard about blockchain, NFTs and smart contracts in passing, but never looked at them in detail. I am surprised how easy it was to create an NFT in the end. The approach of tackling a topic with an artifact was new and inspiring for me. Creative Commons \u00b6 In collaboration with FabLab BCN, Manchester Metropolitan University and SODA, we explored the potential of Web3 technologies such as blockchain, NFTs, DAOs and smart contracts. The aim was to explore how these technologies could reshape the creative industries landscape and governance models. Web3 technologies \u00b6 Blockchain, at its core, acts as a decentralized and secure ledger that provides an immutable record of transactions and data. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) serve as unique digital assets that certify ownership and authenticity. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) represent a new form of governance where decision-making is encoded in smart contracts and executed autonomously. Smart contracts automate the execution of predefined agreements and eliminate the need for intermediaries. Dafne+ platform \u00b6 Dafne+ is a joint project of SODA and Fablab BCN that offers a promising solution to revolutionize the distribution of content using Web3 technologies. This platform gives creators the opportunity to secure their intellectual property rights by minting NFTs. These NFTs ensure transparent and immutable records of ownership and transactions on the blockchain, promoting trust and fairness in the creative ecosystem. Collaborative project - fascination: \u00b6 Our collaborative project focused on tackling the resurgence of fascism through an innovative VR educational game on the Dafne+ platform. Players are immersed in a simulated city under fascist rule, where they observe, interact and analyze the social dynamics. Their observations are recorded in the blockchain and promote discussions and insights on how to combat extremist ideologies. Proceeds generated from the minting of NFT avatars within the game fund de-radicalization efforts through a DAO. This decentralized approach empowers NFT owners with decision-making authority, ensuring community-driven initiatives in the fight against radicalization. In summary, our exploration of Web3 technologies and the implementation of the Dafne+ platform exemplify a paradigm shift in intellectual property rights management and content distribution. Through collaborative efforts and innovative solutions, we strive to foster a more equitable and inclusive creative ecosystem while addressing pressing societal challenges.
