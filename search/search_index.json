Overall, the methodology gave me a lot of clarity and showed me many issues that I had not previously considered or was not aware of. It has helped me to efficiently find a good visualization of various topics I already know a little about, and to discover connections and new possibilities within these areas. 01 Collective Excercice \u00b6 In the \u201cBig Round\u201d, to be honest, I didn\u2019t understand a lot of points acoustically and as a result I did not contribute as much thematically. Nevertheless, it helped me to understand the approach of the methodology. After that, we tested the method again in the group and had a successful brainstorming round and drew cards that worked much better for me thematically. I was therefore very excited to put together my own Atlas and to find the right cards and topics for me afterwards. 02 Personal AoWS \u00b6 As a first draft, I looked through all the cards and formed pairs that resulted in interesting themes for me, which I then sorted out and found 3 favourite pairs. The decision to choose a final pair was not easy for me, because there was a lot of interesting potential in all of them. Thus I decided for an area that has been on my mind a lot this past year. How can we use AI\u2019s and data in a way that it makes sense? 03 Additions \u00b6 In addition to the existing cards, I have considered one opportunity area and two random triggers that I have personally encountered in the past and that are very important to me. One is the area of digital collaboration, which got rediscovered intensly around the time of the pandemic and required pure remote collaboration. It has proven to be a new opportunity area for many technologies. My other area of interest is inclusion and accessibility. Both of these vast topics could actually be opportunity areas as well, but I have classified them as random triggers because I think they should actually be considered in all opportunity areas that one chooses. The separation of the \u201csimilar\u201d topics is also consciously chosen because inclusion is often quickly labeled as an accessibility topic, but also includes cultural inclusion, linguistic inclusion, gender inclusion and much more. As in my understanding, these topics are as well a part of equality and kill-the-heteropatriarchy, but in my opinion were not directly visible among the proposed topics. 04 Multiscalar Personal Design Space \u00b6 I have merged my personal AoWS with my previous personal experience and toolset to create a multiscalar design space. I collected first references and projects that match my interests and the chosen design space and put methods, courses, weak signals, infrastructures and possible intervention areas into context from my point of view. 05 the \u201cFirst Draft\u201d Design Space \u00b6 In my final atlas, I added more cards from the deck that fit thematically and emerged from the multiscalar design space. The combination of technology, collaboration, sustainability and inclusion leads to many ideas in the open source area. AI\u2019s and data that can be used to drive society forward, foster collaboration and promote inclusion. First ideas that came into my mind are in the field of maker education adn digital collaboration from human to human or from human to machine. Because I believe it is important not only to make technology usable for all but also to make it understood by all and to give citizens more control over their own data sharing. Of course, this is also the area that seems most tangible and feasible to me, but there are surely many more areas to research in this design space, which I am very excited about.","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/Design/AtlasofWeakSignals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"In the first design class, after an initial introduction on how to use the Atlas of Weak Signals to figure out future research areas, we were given our own set of cards, which I used to dig deeper into my first design space.

I used most of the prototyping roles already in my previous work but not that conciously and some of them only conceptual and with a small amount of people. Role 1:The prototype as an experimental component selftest This role is mainly used to check assumptions in order to test the application. I would use this role mainly to test a concept or idea, but at a later stage of the project process. It is often the easiest and fastest way to prototype, but of course does not take into account other people\u2019s opinions, which can be used, but is not the only approach. Especially in a project discovery phase, this method can limit the research space and design space. Most of the people I have worked with in the past have used this prototyping approach. This is also what I learned at my university. for example, I used it to test an app with clickdummy prototypes or for small proof of concepts in the form of an Arduino prototype. Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry I sometimes used it in the form of a questionnaire at the beginning of the project. Most of the time, however, we already knew what we wanted here and approached the questionnaire in a certain way. The real approach is not knowing the end goal. To ask and receive questions. Example: I did a research project on sustainable food for 4 months. The goal was to develop an idea and a low-fi prototype. We were really inexperienced in this field and we opened one topic after another and ended up where we didn\u2019t expect it before. Of course, also because the theme was very extensive for 4 months. I think this role takes time. It is also important to analyze everything considering the circumstances and the environment. Role 3: The prototype as a reasearch archetype As a tool to express a problem/topic. Give information and trigger thinking I know it mostly from exhibitions. Example: Exhibition Amsterdam a room with cameras which is tracking faces and interpreting peoples connection. Let people question privacy and monitoring. Role 4: The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry This Role of Prototyping is usefull to answer questions by making. Example: i explored in one semester with a planting system, and tested multiple ways to make home growing food more efficient but we also got tips from experts which lead us in a specific direction. Group exercice \u00b6 We did a little exercise in our group to better understand the roles of prototyping. We talked about past projects and classified them into the different roles. We noticed that in many projects we saw several roles of prototyping and we unconsciously used them simultaneously or distributed in the design process. Then we built a quick alternative prototype for a different person in the group. I built a porototype for Jorghe. he had a project for an alternative lint roller that worked like a razor and therefore had almost no wear parts. We put his project in role 1, because he tested it himself. I made a test kit to analyze the intuition of different users as well as the approach to different fabrics. This prototype is type role 4, because you don\u2019t know where the result will lead you and you approach the users with a question. My Extended Workspace \u00b6 As a further exercise, everyone created their own personal extended workspace. My workspace is divided into 2 sides, on the one hand collaborative possibilities with my network and things I can do at home alone. I have mainly worked on my laptop and designed digital products, but I have also gained some experience in 3d printing when I needed a case for an arduino prototype. Most of the things on the collaborative side are possibilities I have little or no experience in and hopefully will learn more about soon. The visualization shows me pretty clearly how much knowledge there is in collaboration with the people around me and in which fields I can learn a lot.
