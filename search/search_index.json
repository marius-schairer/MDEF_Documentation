Overall, the methodology gave me a lot of clarity and showed me many issues that I had not previously considered or was not aware of. It has helped me to efficiently find a good visualization of various topics I already know a little about, and to discover connections and new possibilities within these areas. 01 Collective Excercice \u00b6 In the \u201cBig Round\u201d, to be honest, I didn\u2019t understand a lot of points acoustically and as a result I did not contribute as much thematically. Nevertheless, it helped me to understand the approach of the methodology. After that, we tested the method again in the group and had a successful brainstorming round and drew cards that worked much better for me thematically. I was therefore very excited to put together my own Atlas and to find the right cards and topics for me afterwards. 02 Personal AoWS \u00b6 As a first draft, I looked through all the cards and formed pairs that resulted in interesting themes for me, which I then sorted out and found 3 favourite pairs. The decision to choose a final pair was not easy for me, because there was a lot of interesting potential in all of them. Thus I decided for an area that has been on my mind a lot this past year. How can we use AI\u2019s and data in a way that it makes sense? 03 Additions \u00b6 In addition to the existing cards, I have considered one opportunity area and two random triggers that I have personally encountered in the past and that are very important to me. One is the area of digital collaboration, which got rediscovered intensly around the time of the pandemic and required pure remote collaboration. It has proven to be a new opportunity area for many technologies. My other area of interest is inclusion and accessibility. Both of these vast topics could actually be opportunity areas as well, but I have classified them as random triggers because I think they should actually be considered in all opportunity areas that one chooses. The separation of the \u201csimilar\u201d topics is also consciously chosen because inclusion is often quickly labeled as an accessibility topic, but also includes cultural inclusion, linguistic inclusion, gender inclusion and much more. As in my understanding, these topics are as well a part of equality and kill-the-heteropatriarchy, but in my opinion were not directly visible among the proposed topics. 04 Multiscalar Personal Design Space \u00b6 I have merged my personal AoWS with my previous personal experience and toolset to create a multiscalar design space. I collected first references and projects that match my interests and the chosen design space and put methods, courses, weak signals, infrastructures and possible intervention areas into context from my point of view. 05 My Design Space \u00b6 01 First Draft \u00b6 In my final atlas, I added more cards from the deck that fit thematically and emerged from the multiscalar design space. The combination of technology, collaboration, sustainability and inclusion leads to many ideas in the open source area. AI\u2019s and data that can be used to drive society forward, foster collaboration and promote inclusion. First ideas that came into my mind are in the field of maker education adn digital collaboration from human to human or from human to machine. Because I believe it is important not only to make technology usable for all but also to make it understood by all and to give citizens more control over their own data sharing. Of course, this is also the area that seems most tangible and feasible to me, but there are surely many more areas to research in this design space, which I am very excited about. 02 Live Design Space (Updated) \u00b6","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/Design/AtlasofWeakSignals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"In the first design class, after an initial introduction on how to use the Atlas of Weak Signals to figure out future research areas, we were given our own set of cards, which I used to dig deeper into my first design space.

Shared Design Space \u00b6 To get us on the same page as a group, we first exchanged ideas verbally on the roof of iaac, which meant that at first glance we didn\u2019t have too much in common. Nevertheless, we decided to work together and not attach ourselves to a completed team. In order to bring our design spaces together independently of the class, we started by introducing our individual design spaces to each other and put all the cards on the table that were included in the card deck.

I used most of the prototyping roles already in my previous work but not that conciously and some of them only conceptual and with a small amount of people. Role 1:The prototype as an experimental component \u00b6 selftest This role is mainly used to check assumptions in order to test the application. I would use this role mainly to test a concept or idea, but at a later stage of the project process. It is often the easiest and fastest way to prototype, but of course does not take into account other people\u2019s opinions, which can be used, but is not the only approach. Especially in a project discovery phase, this method can limit the research space and design space. Most of the people I have worked with in the past have used this prototyping approach. This is also what I learned at my university. for example, I used it to test an app with clickdummy prototypes or for small proof of concepts in the form of an Arduino prototype. Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry \u00b6 I sometimes used it in the form of a questionnaire at the beginning of the project. Most of the time, however, we already knew what we wanted here and approached the questionnaire in a certain way. The real approach is not knowing the end goal. To ask and receive questions. Example: I did a research project on sustainable food for 4 months. The goal was to develop an idea and a low-fi prototype. We were really inexperienced in this field and we opened one topic after another and ended up where we didn\u2019t expect it before. Of course, also because the theme was very extensive for 4 months. I think this role takes time. It is also important to analyze everything considering the circumstances and the environment. Role 3: The prototype as a reasearch archetype \u00b6 As a tool to express a problem/topic. Give information and trigger thinking I know it mostly from exhibitions. Example: Exhibition Amsterdam a room with cameras which is tracking faces and interpreting peoples connection. Let people question privacy and monitoring. Role 4: The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry This Role of Prototyping is usefull to answer questions by making. Example: i explored in one semester with a planting system, and tested multiple ways to make home growing food more efficient but we also got tips from experts which lead us in a specific direction. Group exercice \u00b6 We did a little exercise in our group to better understand the roles of prototyping. We talked about past projects and classified them into the different roles. We noticed that in many projects we saw several roles of prototyping and we unconsciously used them simultaneously or distributed in the design process. Then we built a quick alternative prototype for a different person in the group. I built a porototype for Jorghe. he had a project for an alternative lint roller that worked like a razor and therefore had almost no wear parts. We put his project in role 1, because he tested it himself. I made a test kit to analyze the intuition of different users as well as the approach to different fabrics. This prototype is type role 4, because you don\u2019t know where the result will lead you and you approach the users with a question. My Extended Workspace \u00b6 As a further exercise, everyone created their own personal extended workspace. My workspace is divided into 2 sides, on the one hand collaborative possibilities with my network and things I can do at home alone. I have mainly worked on my laptop and designed digital products, but I have also gained some experience in 3d printing when I needed a case for an arduino prototype. Most of the things on the collaborative side are possibilities I have little or no experience in and hopefully will learn more about soon. The visualization shows me pretty clearly how much knowledge there is in collaboration with the people around me and in which fields I can learn a lot.

You become part of the community that develops the idea and design not for others but with others. Everything that surrounds you can and will influence your project. The first person perspective makes it possible to think by testing and experiencing. Magic Machines \u00b6 what you had to do \u00b6 For the first workshop, led by Kristina Andersen, we brought junk from home that could be used for prototyping to build a Low Fi prototype of a Companion. An object that accompanies us in everyday life but is not specifically adapted to us. To get started quickly with a prototype, we chose one of the 16 basic human desires. What did it end up being, and what materials did you use ? \u00b6 For my prototype I used a pencil, foam rubber wooden sticks and an old hairdryer to build a food spinner that can be modularly limited but can also randomly decide on a meal to cook or buy. What were you Thinking ? \u00b6 The first thought that came to my mind on the subject of \u201cneed of food\u201d was to randomly try new things. At the same time, it struck me how many decisions you can make about food when you try to break it down to its basic building blocks. and that you\u2019ll add more and more building blocks to bring in more randomness, but at the same time you\u2019ll control the randomness again. Why does it matter ? \u00b6 When using the magic machine, I realized that I had limited myself through the modularity and categorization. With the basic ingredients I chose, I still came up with dishes I already knew, which in retrospect is logical because I wrote down the categories while I was thinking about different dishes I knew. So the prototype was too controlled and couldn\u2019t give me new cooking ideas or create more variety. 1PP Research - Embodying your ideas \u00b6 I put myself in the Ai area for a day and tried to solve everything with ai. I only used ai to do the research, so I couldn\u2019t watch a video tutorial on youtube made by a human. I only followed the ai instructions. What happens when you involve yourself ? \u00b6 involving myself in the topic helped me to understand where i stand in the topic, what assumptions and prejudices i have and how much i still don\u2019t know. I already knew about chat Gpt and Perplexity ai, so I started researching straight away. I come from a UI/UX background, so I already knew a bit about what was possible, but I hadn\u2019t tried it myself yet. I immediately tried to take giant steps and test the ai without knowing which and how to use the tools. This naturally influenced the experiment, which meant that I was only able to detach myself from it late on and start from 0. What happens when you use yourself as an instrument ? \u00b6 Using myself as an instrument has helped me to change my perception of the subject. I suddenly saw the ai much more as a kind of companion who now accompanies me permanently and tries to understand how the au \u201cfeels\u201d the ai, how it tastes, how it sounds, how it thinks and how it looks. It has inspired me and triggered my imagination, giving me initial ideas on how to abstract it. Accepting that I am now actively working with the ai on a permanent basis and seeing her as a companion has raised new questions for me and shown me that with my initial approach I actually only wanted to take from the ai and facilitate my work without giving anything back, which is quite atypical for a well-functioning cycle. What if I helped the ai and did tasks for it so that it could develop and we could ultimately develop together? what if there was an ai concept in which not just a few super-smart developers defined how the ai should develop, how it should think and what its limits are? What if there was a distributed citizen-participatory ai development ? Did anything change about the way of working ? \u00b6 Because I worked alone and the experiment had no specific goal other than to put myself in the subject, I was not restricted in my thinking and could follow every thought no matter how long it took or how crazy it was. I learned to come to terms with my own abilities and to understand that assumptions in an idea can be quickly disproved in active experience. What does it mean for your future work ? \u00b6 In my future work i will mainly use the method to start a new project and gain a quick and deep understanding. So far, I have tended to tackle huge topics such as sustainable nutrition or inclusion in mobility, which always required external expert knowledge. In retrospect, the first-person perspective would have helped me to find a direction more quickly and to generate knowledge in order to then approach the right experts that I need for my project and to avoid unnecessary questions or to discover things that an expert might overlook due to their long experience. Of course, I wouldn\u2019t put all my faith in one way of thinking and no longer believe in experts, but I will use it in a hybrid format to be able to change my perspective in a project. Another possible application would be to use the first person perspective to help other people change their perspective, for example in a workshop format. After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration ? \u00b6 Seeing the experiments of others helped me to understand how simple a setup can be and that I often approach things far too complicated. Thematically, I was able to recognize myself in many areas. on the one hand, of course, with people who also played with perception and made themselves intensely dependent on one thing, but on the other hand also people who tackled topics that I also address in my designspace.","title":"Living with Your Own Ideas"},{"location":"term1/Design/LwYoI/#first-person-perspective","text":"In short, the first person perspective is to involve yourself in a design space and actively experience it in order to shape it.

The color range of this monitor would typically be 16.7 million colors, which is standard for most Full HD displays. A computer monitor displays visual information, such as text, images, videos, and graphics, generated by a computer or electronic device. It serves as a user interface, is essential for entertainment, gaming, professional work, and information presentation, and is used in various industries and educational settings. How does it work? \u00b6 It has 2 kinds inputs; power and data, on teh other side, the screen visuals are the output. There\u2019s a processor that gets information from the PC on which is connected. When it recives the inputs, the processor powers the LCD screen, LCDs work by controlling the orientation of liquid crystal molecules within each pixel to allow or block the passage of light. By using voltage and color filters, they create images and colors on the screen. Backlights provide the illumination. How is it built? \u00b6 The whole device consists of 2 main parts (external and internal) and different pieces inside them: 1.1. Frame: Made out of PMMA injection mode, it holds the screen to the general structure. 1.2. Backcover: Made out of HIPS injection mode, its acts as a container and protector of all the internal components of the monitor. Th user interacts with it by plugging and unplugging the device. 1.3. LCD Screen: The manufacture of an LCD screen involves steps like preparing glass substrates, adding thin-film transistors and color filters, aligning liquid crystals, sealing the cell, and placing a backlight and finally, the electronic components are integrated. 2.1. Internal container: Made of SPTE (Steel Plate Tinplate Electroplate) by metal cutting and folding in order to give it a structural resistance, it\u2019s function is to contain the rest of the internal parts of the device. 2.2. Power supply board: Made of different layers of FR-4 (fiberglass-reinforced epoxy), by printing the design on a copper-clad board, etching away excess copper, drilling holes, placing and soldering components, testing for functionality, and, if successful, assembling the final product. It\u2019s function is to convert the electricity taken from the plug into the motherboard. 2.3. Motherboard: The materials and manufacturing processes are the same as the Power Supply Board. The motherboard takes the information from the computer and sends it to the LCD screen. The part 1.3. LCD Screen has it\u2019s different components inside, which are: Backlight: This is not a layer within the LCD panel itself, but it is an essential component. The backlight is responsible for providing the light source that passes through the other layers to create the image. In this case, the technology is LED. 1.3.1. Rear Polarizer: The backlight produces unpolarized light. The rear polarizer is the first layer encountered by the light, and its role is to polarize the light so that it vibrates in a particular direction. 1.3.2. Glass Substrate: Two glass substrates, an upper and a lower one. Liquid crystals are sandwiched between these substrates. 1.3.3. Front Polarizer: Like the rear polarizer, the front polarizer is responsible for polarizing the light. However, it is oriented perpendicular to the rear polarizer. When the liquid crystals change orientation, they can affect the polarization of the light and determine whether it can pass through. 1.3.4. Liquid Crystals: These are the active elements of the LCD panel. Liquid crystals change their orientation in response to an applied electric field. This change in orientation affects the passage of polarized light. 1.3.5. Color Filters: Color filters are used to create the full range of colors. They are located above the front glass substrate and consist of red, green, and blue filters, which are arranged in a pattern to generate different colors. 1.3.6. Thin-Film Transistors (TFTs): Thin-film transistors are used to control the orientation of the liquid crystals. Each pixel typically has its own transistor, allowing for precise control of individual pixels. 1.3.7. Alignment Layers: These layers help ensure that the liquid crystals align properly when no voltage is applied. Why did it failed, or it wasn\u2019t used anymore? \u00b6 The older products were phased out and replaced by newer, technologically advanced alternatives that boasted significantly improved resolution and color quality. These cutting-edge replacements set a new standard in terms of visual fidelity, offering a superior and more vibrant color palette, as well as remarkable image clarity and detail. This transition to the latest products not only met the growing demands of consumers for enhanced visual experiences but also reflected the relentless pursuit of innovation and excellence within the industry. The current plugs are old and only support VGA connections, lacking HDMI compatibility. To address this issue, we need to obtain suitable adapters that can bridge the gap between these older VGA connectors and modern HDMI interfaces. These adapters facilitate the transmission of high-definition multimedia content, ensuring compatibility and integration of older equipment with contemporary display and audiovisual systems. Using these adapters allows for improved visual and audio quality, enhancing the functionality of the existing hardware within today\u2019s technological landscape.

LCD screen testing Testing \u00b6 Testing tools: \u00b6 Power Supply Multimeter Gives a certain amount of voltage to the components in a localized place Helps us measure the voltage, intensity, connectivity or resistance of the components General system testing \u00b6 We started the general testing after disassembeling the whole device. We attempted to connect back every component as it was before, to check what was wrong with it. We found out that the LCD screen worked and the power supply also but we couldn\u2019t send any image to the monitor. We concluded that the cable that connects the motherboard to the LCD screen wasn\u2019t working correctly. LCD screen testing \u00b6 We first disassembeled the different layers and frames leaving us with only the backlight connected to the boards. We tried powering the backlight with the power supply from the board. But the backlight didn\u2019t work even with higher voltage. While doing the testing we accidentally broke the cables connecting the LCD screen to the power supply. That\u2019s why we decided tear apart the backlight to test the LED strings alone. Using the cables that we knew that worked and the power supply, we managed to light the strings with a voltage of 27V. The connector has 4 different pins, each one of the lights a string of 10 LEDs, so we were able to control with section we wanted to light. From this testing we concluded that the cables connecting the LEDs with the power supply board were old and got broken during the process. Results \u00b6 How many motors did we find inside? \u00b6 The Samsung EX2220X monitor does not typically include any motors.It is primarily a display device with electronic components for video processing and adjustment, but it doesn\u2019t contain motors. Does it contain a computer or microcontroller? \u00b6 The monitor receives video signals from the connected device and displays them on its screen. While monitors often have some internal electronics for controlling settings like brightness, contrast, and color, they do not have a computer or microcontroller with general computing capabilities like running software or processing data independently. The actual computing tasks are handled by the device to which the monitor is connected. Did you find any sensors? \u00b6 While it has some basic sensors for power management and display adjustment purposes, it doesn\u2019t contain sensors for things like touch input, ambient light sensing, proximity detection, or accelerometers, which are commonly found in devices like smartphones and tablets.
