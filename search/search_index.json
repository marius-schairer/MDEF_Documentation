Nevertheless, it helped me to understand the approach of the methodology. After that, we tested the method again in the group and had a successful brainstorming round and drew cards that were much better for me thematically. I was therefore very excited to put together my own atlas and to find the right cards and topics for me. 02 Personal AoWS \u00b6 As a first step, I looked through all the cards and formed pairs that resulted in interesting themes for me, which I then sorted out and found 3 favorite pairs. the decision to choose a final pair was not really easy for me, because I found all the themes very interesting. 03 Additions \u00b6 In addition to the existing cards, i have considered one opportunity area and two random triggers that i have personally encountered in the past and that are very important to me. One is the topic of digital collaboration, which came about at the time of the pandemic and required pure remote collaboration and has proven to be a new opportunity area for many technologies. the other is the topic of inclusion and accessibility. Both of these could actually be opportunity areas as well, but I have classified them as random triggers because I think they should actually be considered in all opportunity areas. The separation of the \u201csimilar\u201d topics is also consciously chosen because inclusion is often quickly labeled as an accessibility topic, but actually also includes cultural inclusion, linguistic inclusion, gender inclusion and much more. actually, these topics are included in the areas of equality and anti-heteropatriarchy, but in my opinion were not directly visible among the proposed topics. 04 Multiscalar Personal Design Space \u00b6 I have merged my personal AoWS with my previous personal experience and toolset to create a multi scalar design space. I collected first references and projects that match my interests and the chosen topic area and put methods, courses, weak signals, infrastructures and possible intervention areas into context from my point of view. 05 the \u201cFinal\u201d Design Space \u00b6 06 Reflection on AoWS \u00b6","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/Design/AtlasofWeakSignals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"In the first design class, after an initial explanation of how to use the atlas of weak signals to work out future research areas, we were given our own deck of cards.","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"term1/Design/AtlasofWeakSignals/#01-collective-excercice","text":"In the Big Round, to be honest, I didn\u2019t understand and contribute too much, both acoustically and thematically.

Walk around \u00b6 We did a walk around at Poblenou and visited some open community Hubs. It really helped to get some examples about what happens in the district of Poblenou and faculty of MDEF. Documenting Design \u00b6 In the first lesson of Documenting Design we learned about how to Document a Research Project. The Documentations I wrote for previous Projects were mostly created in the last weeks of the Project looking back to what happened and only showing only the Highlights and what was usefull for the end result. So this lesson changed my perspective to document and show everything to create a clear picture about the path of thoughts. Also to document failures so other people won\u2019t fail at the same point and can understand decitions better, makes sense to me. Building Website \u00b6 To Document all of our Work,Experiences and Progress we had to Setup a Git Repository with a Website to share information. I learned some coding basics in my previous studies but it still took me a while to setup the Website.
