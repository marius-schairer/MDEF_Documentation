You can follow me here and I will share my thoughts and experiences. My path has led from a technical school to an Internet of Things (IoT) degree program, where I mainly designed Projects that were sustainable and socially driven, to a master degree program focused in the field of research, knowledge sharing and communities, in Barcelona.

Walk around \u00b6 We did a walk around at Poblenou and visited some open community Hubs. It really helped to get some examples about what happens in the district of Poblenou and faculty of MDEF. Documenting Design \u00b6 In the first lesson of Documenting Design we learned about how to Document a Research Project. The Documentations I wrote for previous Projects were mostly created in the last weeks of the Project looking back to what happened and only showing only the Highlights and what was usefull for the end result. So this lesson changed my perspective to document and show everything to create a clear picture about the path of thoughts. Also to document failures so other people won\u2019t fail at the same point and can understand decitions better, makes sense to me. Building Website \u00b6 To Document all of our Work,Experiences and Progress we had to Setup a Git Repository with a Website to share information. I learned some coding basics in my previous studies but it still took me a while to setup the Website.
