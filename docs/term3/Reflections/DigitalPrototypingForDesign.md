# Reflection

We want to build a clay table. Our initial idea was to use a arduino motor but it won't be strong enough. we saw a project at fabacademy which inspired us to research more. We found out that we would need at least a 1/2 hp motor to make it usable. We decided to continue with a manual push table.
