# Reflection
Aqui's session on scaling projects beyond MDEF provided valuable insights into transitioning ideas into sustainable initiatives. They shared their journey from a collective to a worker's cooperative, emphasizing strategic planning and sustainability. Their projects, like "Teixent Superilles" and "Parking," showcased the importance of local impact and strategic investment. They highlighted the need for long-term vision and capacity building, stressing community building and delegation. The session concluded with an exercise on project scalability, prompting reflection on future development. I could find similarities in the approaches to our current research projects and I got great inspiration on how we could work together with the city and in the area of participation.
