# Reflection
In our recent class, we delved into the intersection of Design and Ethics,  by Ariel Guersenzvaig. This session underscored how technology isn't just a tool but a reflection of societal values and power dynamics. Ariel challenged the idea of technological neutrality, highlighting how technology embeds and perpetuates social inequalities. We explored how design shapes technology, acknowledging its inherent biases and the need to imbue it with ethical values. Discussions on philosophical approaches to design ethics, including indigenous worldviews, broadened our perspective. Overall, the class urged us to critically engage with technology's ethical dimensions, inspiring me to rethink narratives of my Project.
