# Reflection
Our module on Critical Transfeminist Design, the last of the term, was divided into two classes to explore how diverse and non-human perspectives impact design.

Exploring Philosophies and Unwrapping Preconceptions
The first class delved into Western philosophical views on the body and identity, discussing concepts from thinkers like Husserl-Ponty and Heidegger on phenomenology. We examined the influence of language on identity through Lacan, Foucault, and Butler, highlighting performativity and resignification. The class also covered the Contrasexual Manifesto by Paul B. Preciado and Transfeminism, emphasizing liberation from traditional gender binaries.

We were encouraged to think critically about design's role in perpetuating or challenging norms and its potential to create just and inclusive structures. This pushed me to consider design's deep social implications beyond Western-centric aesthetics.

Final Exercise
The second class continued with an exercise to create and empathize with a tiny one-celled organism, reinforcing the importance of empathy in design, but i couldn't take part in that Session.

Final Thoughts
The first class was inspiring, connecting philosophy, feminism, and design, and underscoring inclusivity and equity.

Overall, the module highlighted the importance of broad perspectives and diverse viewpoints in design to avoid exclusionary practices.
