# Reflection
In the third microchallange, we had actually planned to prototype and build a new structure for the prototype, but ended up coding because we had to make a few improvements to the ai architecture in order to train the ai collaboratively and interactively. We could make good use of the time with the support we got and built the new structure later [see here ->](https://marius-schairer.github.io/MDEF_Documentation/term3/DPFD/DigitalPrototypingForDesign01/).
We learned a lot of new things trying to influence ai's response behavior with local databases and turned a local one script into a fullstack with server, database and laia as interface.
