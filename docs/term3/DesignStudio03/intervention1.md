# Connecting to communities
As a first intervention this semester we contacted akasha to plan workshops and get a potential location for the MDEF festival. We visited Carmen, brought our bot and showed her our current status. she was directly very invested and connected us with some communities in el clot. as a result, we have now narrowed down the project to this neighborhood for the next steps. We are still in contact with the various communities and are trying to arrange workshops.
