# Reflection

This microchallange has brought us a considerable step forward in our understanding of ai. we programmed our first ai application without having learned python beforehand. We were surprised how much we were able to do in the 3 days without any previous knowledge. For this challenge, however, we upgraded to GPT4 to use python assistants and to have the current status on the integration of openai. GPT helped us a lot in this case to understand basic structures, but it also led to confusion as soon as the code got a bit longer. We had to really understand the architecture and ask the right questions to get individual functions and precise answers that we could then integrate. Apart from the programming side, we were also able to get another quick insight into lasercutting and engraved plexiglass, which also gave us a few learnings.
