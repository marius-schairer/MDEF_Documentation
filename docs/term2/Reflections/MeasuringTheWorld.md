# Reflection
The class was very helpful for me as it is directly related to my design space. It was interesting to understand the different approaches to measure. I have always tried to measure everything myself, which has led to complex installations, but the limitations we had in the workshop helped us to simplify our approach and integrate external data that already exists. 

I had already dealt with the topic of data on pedestrians in my bachelor's thesis. at that time we tried to trace paths that were accessible for wheeled mobility such as wheelchairs, bicycles, scooters,.... . i found it interesting to see that we again came to the topic of pedestrian data in this independent group, but from a completely different perspective. there is endless data on how to get from a to b by public or private motorized transport, but hardly any data on where to walk. most maps don't even show sidewalks or streets. Also the Group with the Physical sensing method was inspiring to me and encouraged me to also do a Physical intervention for the Design Studio class.
