# Podcast Reflection
Recording a podcast and talking about the project and the issues we are dealing with definitely helped to sort out some thoughts and express them more clearly. Personally, however, I was too focused on other things because of the recording situation and couldn't really listen to the conversation and only understood Oliver when I watched it again.
