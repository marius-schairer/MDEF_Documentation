`Work in Progress`
# Reflection
Due to a misunderstanding, we first created a presentation deck for each other, which helped us to understand how much the other person understood of the concept. In the second step, we then created a presentation deck for ourselves. In this case, i expanded my elevator pitch. through the exercise, i realized that i was still lacking a bit in my communication strategy.
