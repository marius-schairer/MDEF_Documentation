# Reflection
The week was very inspirational. I had only heard about blockchain, NFTs and smart contracts in passing but never researched them in detail. I am surprised how easy it was to create an nft in the end. The approach of tackling a topic with an artifact was new and inspiring mfor me.

## Creative Commons
In a collaborative effort involving FabLab BCN, Manchester Metropolitan University, and SODA, we delved into the transformative potential of Web3 technologies such as Blockchain, NFTs, DAOs, and Smart Contracts. Our aim was to explore how these technologies could reshape the landscape of creative industries and governance models.

## Web3 Technologies
Blockchain, at its core, acts as a decentralized and secure ledger, providing an immutable record of transactions and data. NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, serve as unique digital assets, certifying ownership and authenticity. DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, represent a novel form of governance, where decision-making is encoded in smart contracts and executed autonomously. Smart Contracts automate the execution of predefined agreements, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

## Dafne+ Platform
Dafne+, a collaborative project spearheaded by SODA & Fablab BCN, emerges as a promising solution to revolutionize content distribution utilizing Web3 Technologies. This platform empowers creators by allowing them to secure their intellectual property rights through the minting of NFTs. These NFTs ensure transparent and immutable records of ownership and transactions on the blockchain, fostering trust and fairness in the creative ecosystem.

## Collaborative Project - Fascination:
Our collaborative endeavor focused on tackling the resurgence of fascism through an innovative VR educational game hosted on the Dafne+ platform. Players immerse themselves in a simulated city under fascist rule, where they observe, interact, and analyze the societal dynamics. Their observations are recorded on the blockchain, fostering discussions and insights into combating extremist ideologies.

Proceeds generated from the minting of NFT avatars within the game fund de-radicalization efforts through a DAO. This decentralized approach empowers NFT owners with decision-making authority, ensuring community-driven initiatives in the fight against radicalization.
In summary, our exploration of Web3 technologies and the implementation of the Dafne+ platform exemplify a paradigm shift in intellectual property rights management and content distribution. Through collaborative efforts and innovative solutions, we strive to foster a more equitable and inclusive creative ecosystem while addressing pressing societal challenges.
