# Reflection on Dialogues
the design dialogues were an inspiring event. it was great to see what everyone else was doing and to exchange ideas. i got to talk to a few people. Looking back, the artifacts we exhibited were very micro, which was super interesting but didn't have any tangible application. After the dialogues, I decided to put the topic of intelligence and interspecies collaboration into context and somehow create added value, so I first had to zoom out again and try to understand how I could put the research into a meaningful context. The technology to really understand the intelligences is high tech and needs some experience to understand it. One possibility I see is to use intelligences and mechanisms as inspiration, to adapt them or to integrate them in a way that is advantageous for the organisms instead of reading them out and using them directly.
