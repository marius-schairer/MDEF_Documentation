# Reflection
for the second intervention i teamed up with nuria and we tried to get involved with the topic of participation and to engage with our community. we brainstormed about methods or coordination, but we realized that we don't know yet exactly what people really need and we don't want to propose a solution yet, but rather receive questions and gain thoughts and inspiration. for this purpose, we have built an audiobox in the microchallange into which citizens can speak and with which we want to go to different places to collect data. our goal is to develop a kind of city bot from this and to transcribe the recorded audio files and possibly also to respond to them.
