        <p>Oatflake was exhibited at the 2025 Design Dialogues 2 of the MDEF faculty, marking a pivotal moment in community-driven AI development. Trained on student websites, it demonstrated comprehensive knowledge of projects, methods, resources, and definitions, enabling users to evaluate data through Q&A and voting while creating community servers for free.</p>
        <p>This exhibition became the breaking moment that shaped our research toward federated knowledge-sharing systems. The success demonstrated that local AI communities could effectively manage and share knowledge while maintaining complete privacy and control over their data.</p>

## Key Innovation

<div class="concept-grid">
    <div class="concept-content">
        <h3>üîß Technical Stack</h3>
        <p>Combines Python, JavaScript, and HTML with Ollama and ngrok to create local community AI systems that operate entirely on-device, ensuring data sovereignty while enabling collaborative intelligence.</p>
        
        <h3>üìä Data Processing</h3>
        <p>Integrates advanced file processing tools from LangChain to split and prepare text data, along with web scraping capabilities for resource analysis.</p>
        
        <h3>ü§ù Community Interface</h3>
        <p>Community members can add data through a remote interface (see BLOB Browser) and retrieve information for search and generation functionality.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="concept-content">
        <p>Oatflake operates on two complementary tracks: <strong>live chat response</strong> for immediate user interaction and <strong>background learning</strong> for continuous model improvement. This design ensures real-time responsiveness while maintaining the system's learning capabilities through local processing with quantized models.</p>

## Local Processing System
*Complete data sovereignty with responsive AI interactions*

<div class="concept-grid">
    <div class="concept-content">
        <h3>1. Local Model Hosting</h3>
        <p>Utilizes Ollama to run quantized language models locally on consumer hardware, eliminating the need for external API calls and ensuring complete privacy of conversations and data.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Secure Tunneling</h3>
        <p>Integrates ngrok for secure community access, allowing remote users to interact with local AI systems through encrypted tunnels while maintaining host control and privacy.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Data Processing Pipeline</h3>
        <p>Leverages LangChain for advanced text processing, document splitting, and web scraping capabilities, enabling sophisticated data ingestion and preparation for local AI models.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Community Integration</h3>
        <p>Supports Q&A functionality and voting mechanisms for content evaluation, enabling communities to collaboratively assess and improve their knowledge systems.</p>
