Emerging economies 
- first session: yes circular economies are the minimum we should work on now but i think more small scale circularity does not define in which scale. 
- Second session: i like the way of thinking of the distributed economies and decentralized infrastructures. Thats the vision i want to follow more
- Third session: it was nice to learn about the open source concepts but i‘m still wondering how long the funds will hold it and at which point there is too many open source initiatives that can not hold themselves anymore 
- Fourth session: it‘s faszinating how he is already in the future and working on regeneration instead of minimizing. Inspiring work and at some point i would love to do research with simmilar approaches within the city.
- All in all i think the future i envision would be some kind of combination of a regenerative distributed economy with a semi open source strategy working together with the industry and government and people.
