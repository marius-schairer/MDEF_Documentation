# Reflection
This week we have heard a lot of theory on extended intelligences from Pao and Daniel and thanks to their effort to present in an easy to understand way, we have gained a basic understanding of neural networks, machine learning models, pipelines and databases. This enables us to communicate with developers and understand the difference and interplay between different subcategories of AI.
