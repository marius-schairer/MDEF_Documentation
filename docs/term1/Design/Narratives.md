# Personal Narratives, collective Storytelling. 

## Narratives

In our recent design class, we explored the nuanced dynamics of power, the body's influence, and language in design. 
### Power Relations
Espinoza's concept highlighted the dual nature of powerâ€”negative and oppressive, alongside positive and empowering.

### What the Body Can Do
emphasized the interconnectedness of the body, its capacity to be affected, and the dynamic exercise of power in shaping relational networks.

### Wor(l)ding
urged active engagement, combining first-person perspective and socio-economic factors to shape unique design worlds.

### Embodied Process
emphasized the need for active engagement and commitment to diverse experiences in the design landscape.


### Narrative and Storytelling
expanded to include sound, personal narratives, and collective storytelling.

### Matter Matters in Processes of Becoming
highlighted the active role of materiality in design narratives.

### SF (String Figures) 
The metaphor illustrated the iterative design process, akin to the dynamic and reciprocal nature of design prototyping.

This class illuminated the multifaceted nature of narratives in design, challenging us to embrace complexity and actively shape the worlds we create.
