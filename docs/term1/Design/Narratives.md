# Personal Narratives, collective Storytelling. 

## Narratives
In our recent design class, we explored the nuanced dynamics of power, the body's influence, and language in design. 
### Power Relations
Espinoza's concept highlighted the negative and oppressive, alongside positive and empowering.

### What the Body Can Do
emphasized the interconnectedness of the body, its capacity to be affected, and the dynamic exercise of power in shaping relational networks.

### Wor(l)ding
urged active engagement, combining first-person perspective and socio-economic factors to shape unique design worlds.

### Embodied Process
emphasized the need for active engagement and commitment to diverse experiences in the design landscape.


### Narrative and Storytelling
expanded to include sound, personal narratives, and collective storytelling.

### Matter Matters in Processes of Becoming
highlighted the active role of materiality in design narratives.

### SF (String Figures) 
The metaphor illustrated the iterative design process, akin to the dynamic and reciprocal nature of design prototyping.

This class illuminated the multifaceted nature of narratives in design, challenging us to embrace complexity and actively shape the worlds we create.

The Arduino serves as a connecting link between the collective and me. During my previous studies, it became a frequent companion for prototyping, introducing me to programming, networks, and their design. This experience reshaped my perspective on digital products, providing a deeper understanding. Initially unfamiliar with how devices worked, the Arduino sparked my realization of untapped data potential and the need for transparency. It became clear that hacking and building could empower individuals to navigate complex systems. Our use of Arduinos aimed at sustainably optimizing processes and fostering social interaction paved the way for a smart city project. This journey exposed me to the principles of open source, inclusion, and participation, defining my current path.
