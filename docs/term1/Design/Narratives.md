The Arduino serves as a connecting link between the collective and me. During my previous studies, it became a frequent companion for prototyping, introducing me to programming, networks, and their design. This experience reshaped my perspective on digital products, providing a deeper understanding. Initially unfamiliar with how devices worked, the Arduino sparked my realization of untapped data potential and the need for transparency. It became clear that hacking and building could empower individuals to navigate complex systems. Our use of Arduinos aimed at sustainably optimizing processes and fostering social interaction paved the way for a smart city project. This journey exposed me to the principles of open source, inclusion, and participation, defining my current path.
