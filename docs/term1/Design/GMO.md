## What is a GMO ?
A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. This is often done to introduce a desirable trait from one organism into another, such as making a plant resistant to pests or a crop more nutritious. GMOs can be plants, animals, or microorganisms, and they are used in various fields including agriculture, medicine, and research.

GMOs are primarily used in agriculture for various purposes, including: <br/>
**Resistance to Insect Damage**: GMO crops are developed to be resistant to insect damage, allowing farmers to apply fewer spray pesticides to protect the crops, thus reducing the environmental impact of pesticide use.

**Tolerance to Herbicides**: GMO crops that are tolerant to herbicides help farmers control weeds without damaging the crops. This reduces the need for tillage, which helps maintain soil health and lower fuel and labor use.

**Resistance to Plant Viruses**: GMO crops, such as the Rainbow papaya, have been developed to be resistant to specific plant viruses, thereby preventing crop loss due to viral infections.

**Improving Yields and Nutritional Quality**: GMO technologies offer more rapid crop improvement and novel genetic strategies for crop improvement, addressing the challenge of improving yields and nutritional quality to meet the growing demand for food in a sustainable way.

**Feed for Animals**: Most GMO crops are used in food for animals like cows, chickens, and fish, contributing to the production of feed ingredients used in food.

**Reduced Need for Pesticides** : Genetic engineering in agriculture has led to reduced costs for food production, reduced need for pesticides, and enhanced nutritional content in some crops.

# How can we sustainably maintain clean cities with "natural" organisms?

## how can we improve air quality in the urban underground using absorbing microorganisms? 

### Problem
...

### Research on Absorbing Bad Air Quality
While there is research on using plants to improve air quality, such as in indoor environments, there is limited information specifically on using fungi, moss, or other organisms to absorb bad air quality in underground spaces. However, there is ongoing research on the use of plants and microorganisms to improve air quality in various settings, which could provide valuable insights for your project

### Considerations
Creating an organism to absorb bad air quality in underground spaces would involve identifying or engineering an organism with the ability to effectively absorb pollutants and thrive in underground conditions. This could potentially involve genetic modification to enhance the organism's natural abilities or introduce new ones. Additionally, considerations such as the organism's impact on the surrounding environment and its ability to survive and reproduce in underground conditions would need to be addressed.

### How would it be possible ?

**Mushroom-Filled Wall Tiles**: A design student at Brunel University in London has developed honeycomb tiles made from mycelium, the part of mushrooms that grows underground. These tiles, called Myco-Hex, are designed to absorb harmful hydrocarbon air pollution caused by traffic emissions and burning fossil fuels. The mycelium-fused fungi in the tiles safely absorbs hydrocarbons, helping to create cleaner air in towns and cities.

**Reishi Mushroom Extract**: Research has shown that reishi mushroom extract can prevent the transmigration of particulate matter into the bloodstream, ultimately preventing oxidative stress caused by pollution exposure. This suggests the potential for using mushroom extracts to protect the body against damage caused by air pollution.

**Mycelium-Based Building Materials**: The Growing Pavilion, a building in the Netherlands, is made from mycelium, the roots of mushrooms. As it grows, it helps to clean the air. Mycelium-based building materials are being used to create environmentally-friendly structures that contribute to air purification.

### Conclusion

## How can a natural alternative to chlorine help us clean the streets of big cities?

### Most Used Cleaning Methods in Barcelona
The most commonly used cleaning method in Barcelona involves the use of chlor-based cleaning agents sprayed on the streets at night. The impact of this method on the environment and human health is a concern. Chlor-based cleaning agents can have negative effects on the environment, including harming aquatic life and disrupting ecosystems. Additionally, exposure to chlor-based cleaning agents can pose health risks to humans, such as respiratory irritation and other health issues.

### Alternative Organisms for Street Cleaning
When considering alternative organisms or bacteria to clean the streets, it's important to focus on those that can absorb harmful bacteria without negatively impacting other species or the environment. Some potential options include using bacteria or organisms that have the ability to absorb harmful bacteria found in urban environments. These organisms could be applied in cleaning detergents or used to create an antibacterial layer on the streets. However, it's crucial to ensure that these alternative organisms do not harm beneficial species and ecosystems in the city.

### Considerations
There are various research projects and initiatives exploring the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for different purposes, including environmental remediation and public health. However, it's essential to consider the ethical implications and potential consequences of using GMOs in urban environments. Ethical questions that need to be addressed include the potential impact on biodiversity, unintended ecological consequences, and public acceptance of GMOs in urban settings. Additionally, it's important to conduct thorough risk assessments and engage in transparent communication with the public regarding the use of GMOs in city cleaning initiatives.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the use of alternative organisms or bacteria, including GMOs, for cleaning urban environments such as Barcelona requires careful consideration of environmental impact, human health, and ethical implications. It's essential to conduct thorough research, risk assessments, and public engagement to ensure the responsible and sustainable implementation of such initiatives.
