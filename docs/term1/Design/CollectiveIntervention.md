# Reflection
During these two weeks, we formed new groups and carried out another intervention in the field of plant computing. For me personally, the influence of the previous weeks in the field of interspecies collaboration and non-human intelligences made it interesting to try to understand how these organisms work and whether it is possible to communicate with them without making genetic modifications. During the research, I realized how many approaches there are that are not comprehensible and that I was motivated by the direction of education and starter kits to simplify complexity and motivate more people to experiment. The intervention also opened up many new questions to me in the field of plant computing and non-human intelligences. How can we understand not only human-induced signals but also noise? and How do different organisms communicate with each other?

# Result

we tried several things in our quest to understand the signals. firstly, we tried to read the signals by directly penetrating the plant with the pins, which was a very intrusive procedure and may have caused the signals we read. at this point, however, we did not yet understand how to understand or interpret the signals. later we found out that you can receive plant signals with heartbeat sensors at a much lower frequency, which we still couldn't understand. the signals from the plant were a constant noise, which could be caused by the electronic hardware or the plant itself. But when you interact with the plant (touch or water) you can definitely see a peak in the signals. that was also our final result of the first week's experiment. we receive signals and know that the plant sends signals when we cause them ourselves. now it would be interesting to understand the noise without us interacting with it
