# Machine Paradox

# Reflection
the two weeks of workshop helped me to better understand what is inside a device and how easy it is to control or repair individual components. when building the fuck duck machine we had to make small changes over and over again to make it work. we had to print and cnc cut different parts to fit the components we took out of the screen. 

# Forensic report
besides the screen, we also disassembled a controller and tried to repair it. the construction was basically very simple and mechanical but in the end it still didn't work because the slider sensors for the x and y axis were worn and old. we could at least control the button but it was not usable for our machine.
