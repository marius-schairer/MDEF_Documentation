## Landing Week

# Kick Off
The Kick of was a great summary of what we will do in the studies of MDEF and for me personally also a confirmation that it is how I understood from reading the booklet and Website and that it will be exciting.


# Walk around

We did a walk around at Poblenou and visited some open community Hubs. It really helped to get some examples about what happens in the district of Poblenou and faculty of MDEF.


# Documenting Design

In the first lesson of Documenting Design we learned about how to Document a Research Project. The Documentations I wrote for previous Projects were mostly created in the last weeks of the Project looking back to what happened and only showing only the Highlights and what was usefull for the end result. So this lesson changed my perspective to document and show everything to create a clear picture about the path of thoughts. Also to document failures so other people won't fail at the same point and can understand decitions better, makes sense to me. 

# Building Website

To Document all of our Work,Experiences and Progress we had to Setup a Git Repository with a Website to share information. I learned some coding basics in my previous studies but it still took me a while to setup the Website.
