I'm Marius

I am currently starting a journey through the MDEF program. You can follow me here and I will share my thoughts and experiences. 
My path has led from a technical school to an Internet of Things (IoT) degree program, where I mainly designed Projects that were sustainable and socially driven, to a master degree program focused in the field of research, knowledge sharing and communities, in Barcelona. I am new to the open source field which I am extremely excited about. I hope to learn methods to tackle any problem.
